**Teaser**

In my [previous article](), I charted my 15-year journey from a wide-eyed newcomer to a CISO and eventually a startup founder. But a map only shows the route—it doesn't prepare you for the terrain. This follow-up is about that terrain: the mental shifts, the hidden hurdles, and the practical realities of each stage. For all the ambitious professionals out there wondering ‘How can I actually do this?’—this is for you. We’re moving past the ‘what’ and into the ‘how.’ This isn’t about boasting; it’s a blueprint to show you that your ambitions are not just dreams—they are achievable realities.

### **The Essence and Core of My Journey**

In my previous publication, I outlined my personal path from a young hired gun to a recognized expert, a leader, a CISO, an expat who immigrated to Europe, and finally, a founder of my own IT startup. However, some nuances, insights, and behind-the-scenes details were left out to keep that already substantial article focused. I believe they are important enough to warrant this new piece.

I’m certain that among the readers are folks like me, walking a similar path, fueled by analogous ambition and drive. This text will help them better prepare for certain pivotal life and career stages. It will provide mental fortitude and inspiration, clearly demonstrating that much of what seems impossible is, in fact, highly achievable.

This material is not bragging or a cheap grab for fame. It's a public statement on potential—a case study proving that you are the architect of your own destiny.

**The Roadmap**
We will sequentially walk through all the key career milestones: **line staff** -> **expert** -> **director/business partner** -> **expat** -> **startup owner**. 

And the life milestones: **moving from a small town to the capital** -> **immigrating as a digital nomad** -> **life through the eyes of an expat in Eastern Europe** -> **immigrating as an extraordinary talent**. 

I'll share my most significant events on this path, the lessons I learned, and prove that **YOU CAN DO IT TOO.**
