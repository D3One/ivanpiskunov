_I burned the map they gave me. Here's the soundtrack to finding my own way._

The lighthouse in the dark, the compass in the storm. I'm sharing the lyrics that guided my rebirth. Let this spark ignite your own fire.

## What Is This?

This is emotion, crystallized into words. A state of being, translated from the depths of my soul—it's the voice of my heart, my true "I." This is my attempt to express the inexpressible through the tools I have: words, voice, and music. This track is the consolidation of my most vital realizations, insights, and the voice within... an offering of my inner world.

## Why Is It Here?

To break your chains. To shatter social limits, handed-down goals, others' dogmas, and outdated beliefs. Be yourself. Be real. Live your life, walk your path. I've gone through this transformation. I did it. You can do it too. Let this spark reach your heart and ignite a fire.

## With Fire in My Heart and a Compass in My Hands: Through the Storms, Homeward

There is no one who doesn't get tired. Only those who don't give up. My path has been filled with challenges and trials, which I've written about before. There were failures, falls, despair, depression—the fire inside grew dim, but it never went out. Music was my refuge. Headphones on, player up loud—it was my salvation when nothing else worked.

The words were born on their own. This is the voice of my soul, expressed in symbols (words, lines) that can be passed on to someone else. It's the raw expression of my emotions during pivotal moments—in times of despair and pain, and the subsequent joy of triumph, the realization that life's milestones have been passed, that the dark night has given way to a new dawn!

**I am writing my story. My voice sounds in my own name.** And you? **You can write your legend!** 

Burn away everything old and unnecessary. Light your way through the storm to a new shore. 

Take this compass—you are the captain of your ship. 

**It's time to leave the harbor.**

# "NO LOOKING BACK"

**[Intro]**

Crossroads, seven lanes. Silence. Just the beat in my ears.
It ain't handing out answers, it just lets me breathe free here.
No more borrowed maps, no whispers from behind.
Just me. And my pick. And the whole world aligned.

**[Verse 1]**

Remember how it started, bro? They handed me the script,
Every step prewritten—pressed like leaves in a book that's stiff.
Life was a gray design, end fixed from the start,
And lemme tell ya—I was a puppet in their works of art.
"Walk straight, don't question, listen to those who are older,"
They hammered fake rules in, nails driven in my shoulder.
So I marched, jaw locked, in a tight cage of "you ought,"
Till my voice turned a whisper—almost erased to naught.
I laid bricks for their castles, in concrete, dust, and strain,
Forgot the beacons burning deep in my chest and brain.
But one cold dawn in the mirror, sleep-heavy, blank as stone,
I saw not me—but a shadow, trained to obey the tone.
Something cracked in the silence—permafrost split in two,
And I asked myself softly, **_"MAN, what do YOU wanna do?"_**

**[Chorus]**

I'm burning every bridge that was leading me wrong,
Tearing up the tickets to rides where I don't belong.
Storm is tearing pages, but I'm still the author,
I won't buy addresses that strangers offered.

My compass is my heartbeat, my atlas is my soul,
I walk toward my light—unhurried, in control.
Behind me only ashes from shackles I outgrew,
My horizon's a blank page — for new worlds to draw through!

**[Verse 2]**

First step felt like a cliff-jump—no rope, no net in sight,
Every instinct screaming, "Go back! That edge ain't right!"
But the air of freedom hit—clean, sweet, and raw,
Better than gilded comfort in a cramped, gold-plated maw.
Suddenly the world lit up with colors I'd never seen,
Turns out there's a hundred roads I used to paint obscene—
'Cause I feared the weight of owning every bruise,
Every win and every loss—no one else to choose.
But that's where the power lives: when scars are yours alone,
Each lesson bled and learned, carved in marrow and bone.
Now I chase my sunrises, not where I was told to go,
But where my spirit leads me—free, steady, and though
Let tomorrow stay unknown—no guarantee in sight,
I trade stale "ever-after" for a billion ways to fight.

**[Bridge]**

They whispered, "Turn around. It's safer, softer there.
You'll break on rocky edges, vanish in empty air."
I heard 'em—but the fire inside kept burning brighter,
Lighting up my markers, making every sign look wider.
'Cause freedom ain't chaos—it's the strictest measure,
It's owning what you choose—your faith, your treasure.
And the taste of that freedom? Sweeter than wine or honey.
Worth every single risk. One of one—no money.

**[Chorus]**

I'm burning every bridge that was leading me wrong,
Tearing up the tickets to rides where I don't belong.
Storm is tearing pages, but I'm still the author,
I won't buy addresses that strangers offered.

My compass is my heartbeat, my atlas is my soul,
I walk toward my light—unhurried, in control.
Behind me only ashes from shackles I outgrew,
My horizon's a blank page — for new worlds to draw through!

**[Outro]**

My path... A blank page...
No borders. Just the sound of my steps.
My road... Mine only...
**_And I'm on my way, MAN!_**
