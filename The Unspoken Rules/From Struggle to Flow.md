# From Struggle to Flow: A New Paradigm for Success

_What if the relentless grind and exhausting struggle aren't the only paths to success? For years, I championed the "self-made man" ethos, believing that achievement was born solely from pain and overcoming. But I discovered a more elegant, powerful way: the path of_ _**Allowance**__. This isn't about cheats or hacks; it's about understanding the fundamental mechanics of reality. It’s a shift from forcing outcomes to allowing them, transforming life from a battle for survival into a captivating game you are designed to win. This is the most important career—and life—lesson I've ever learned._

**Introduction: A Departure from the Known**
--------------------------------------------

This is not my typical article. For the first time, I'm stepping away from my own rules to publish something that has no direct link to cybersecurity. Yet, in my view, this might be the most crucial piece I've ever written—but only for those who are ready to hear it.

My entire career and life journey, from my university days (2005/2010) to the present, which I've detailed in my previous publications, can be characterized as a **fight**. It was a battle for a better position, a climb to the top through hardships, achieving through sheer force of will, building strength through pain, and forging character by confronting obstacles. This is a real, functional path. It's one of the most common, logical, and often-chosen routes. However, as I discovered much later, it is not the most efficient or optimal one.

**The "Self-Made Man": Forged in Fire**
---------------------------------------

For many years, I lived by the "self-made man" model: pain was the fuel for growth, lack was the primary motivator, and the thirst to prove my worth to myself and the world was my driving force. Problems and challenges were my personal growth zone.

This path did make me who I am today. It tempered my character, developed specific skills, shaped my value system, set my priorities, and cleared my surroundings of the "crab bucket" mentality. This experience is invaluable to me. The contribution of this path deserves respect and honor. It's like a champion's belt, earned through pain, sweat, blood, countless trainings, limitations, and sacrifices. It is, unquestionably, a path for the strong.

But I used to see it as the _only_ option for achieving the results I wanted. Through my search for answers, guided by mentors I met along the way, personal reflection, training, a vast library of books, testing hypotheses, and discussions with people of different mindsets and wealth, I finally realized: **It is not the only way.**

**The Trap of the "Struggle" Mindset**
--------------------------------------

The paradigm of "limited resources"—money, time, health, influence, fame—is the default operating system for most people on the planet. This breeds competition, the idea of scarcity, and inherent greed. It's the root cause of conflicts, inequality, and the feeling that you must _wrestle_ your share from the world.

In this game, the challenges keep getting bigger, the stakes higher. You gain more, but you have to overcome even more. You become more resilient, but new blows test your limits. Iteration after iteration, it often feels like you're always one step behind. It's a game you can't truly win. Any fighter eventually gets tired on the ring; any runner has to stop. I experienced burnout, apathy, and spent months in a depressed state. I fell, figuratively speaking, but I got up, kept moving, stumbled again, failed, but always pushed forward. Yet, each time, it demanded more and more energy. This is the price of the "Struggle" path.

**The Alternative: The Power of "Allowance"**
---------------------------------------------

In opposition to "Struggle" (force, pressure, conquest) stands the concept of **"Allowance."** This is not a popular model, though it has existed since the beginning of time. There is no "secret" here. I'm not revealing anything that wasn't already known.

**"Allowance" is uniqueness over competition. It is the assumption of abundance and sufficiency of all necessary resources, versus the assumption of scarcity.** It's not about taking something away, but about creating something new of your own. You earn more, buy a better car, gain respect and recognition not through a meat grinder, but by leveraging timely opportunities, unique coincidences, unexpected surprises, synchronicities, and unanticipated help.

This is the path of least resistance. It's the way of the diplomat who leads successful negotiations, not the conqueror with an army.

**Shifting Your Vector: From "Running From" to "Moving Toward"**
----------------------------------------------------------------

For a long time, I was moving **"Away From"** something: away from the cold climate of my hometown, away from low salaries, broken roads, and the poverty mindset of my then-surroundings.

However, the more optimal and truthful path is to move **"Toward"** something: toward my dream home, personal comfort, the ability to travel the world without limits, toward starting my own company, creating a legacy. This is the path of creation, of building something better, something new.

Consider these two scenarios:

1.  Frantically searching for a way to make a lot of money because you can't pay rent, or risking everything on a business to escape debt.
    
2.  Looking for a new job because you've outgrown your old one, starting a business because you are now capable, beginning something new for self-realization and increased comfort.
    

One path comes from desperation and external pressure. The other comes from inspiration and an internal drive for self-realization. This aligns perfectly with Maslow's hierarchy of needs: the path from scarcity moves from the bottom of the pyramid, while the path of self-realization aims directly for the peak. The results might look similar, but the **quality of life during the journey will be vastly different.**

**What "Allowance" Really Is (And Isn't)**

"Allowance" can be viewed from two angles:

1.  **The Psychological:** Changing your mindset, limiting beliefs, and reaction patterns. Re-evaluating personal values, setting your own priorities, boosting self-esteem, changing your environment, and working through guilt, trauma, and triggers from the past.
    
2.  **The Metaphysical:** Visualizing your future, understanding that "earthly life is like a video game," and learning the laws of the universe—not as mass-knowledge, but as something verified by your own personal experience. This includes practices like visualization, meditation ("The Hour of Peace" to shift brain waves to Alpha), scripting future events, and practicing gratitude.
    

This is not about using "cheat codes" to wake up one day with a pile of money and fame. It's about deeply understanding the game's mechanics and using them effectively. It’s about dramatically increasing the effectiveness of your actions to complete the game with a top-player rating.

### **"Allowance" is Not a Magic Pill**

Let's be clear: **"Allowance" is not a magic pill.** It is a path that demands significant mental discipline, a paradigm shift in thinking, and the concentration of your mental faculties. The effort required can be as substantial as on the path of "Struggle," but it's directed at different targets.

In the beginning, it will feel like a difficult workout for a gym novice. You will likely experience temporary discomfort, a loss of confidence, overwhelming doubts, and the fear of losing everything. This is normal. This is the "Old You" being replaced by the "New You." It's a necessary stage of personal transformation where the truth of your desires is tested, along with your faith in the end result and your ability to cultivate your best qualities: discipline, persistence, decisiveness, and the ability to let go of the past.

Therefore, "Allowance" is not a cheat code that instantly alters your 3D reality. It's the same life in the physical sense—the seasons will still change, and the day will still have 24 hours. The difference is similar to how Bill Gates or Pavel Durov spends their day versus the routine of an hourly employee at McDonald's or a truck driver.

By choosing "Allowance" over "Struggle," I don't become less. I don't lose my "self-made" status. In the eyes of others, I am still the person who rose from the bottom, built himself, his business, his body, his relationships, and created his legacy. However, **I no longer pay an exorbitant price for the result.** I don't need "a pile of money first" to start something. The effectiveness of my actions becomes 3x, sometimes 5x or 10x greater than if I had proceeded through "struggle."

So, this is not about "sitting on the stove at home" or "waiting for manna from heaven." It is not passivity, as it might seem to the average person. It is an active stance, but one that originates from a different source—where much of the work is often hidden from view.

**The Unspoken Truth**
----------------------

I'm not afraid to write about this because there is no "secret" to be afraid of revealing. Not all readers will understand. Many might dismiss it, accuse me of heresy, or label me a pseudo-guru. That is their reaction, their choice. I am not proving, persuading, or selling anything.

This article is simply an expression of knowledge I have felt and personally tested. For most people, even with a step-by-step guide, this will seem complex, implausible. You can't just _read_ about it; you have to _realize_ it. In Zen Buddhism, truth cannot be transmitted with words; it can only be realized internally.

This publication is not a practical guide. It is an explanation that you can achieve success in the broadest sense of the word in a more optimal way. This doesn't mean you won't have to work. You will. The challenges will be serious, but they won't come from a place of compulsion or fear. They will feel like an interesting adventure, a complex but engaging game with a predictable result.

You will still have to learn programming languages, master Linux core utilities, or dive into the intricacies of sales. But it won't lead to burnout. It will be dosed, like the Pareto 80/20 principle in action. It's not about knowing a lot about everything, but about knowing the right things that are truly valued.

### **The Gameplay is Live. The Question is How You'll Play.**

Remember the scene in GTA: San Andreas where the hero appears out of nowhere, with a zero balance, and begins his climb to the top of the criminal underworld? Well, you were also born. Your storyline is live. The timer is ticking. Whether you like it or not, the game has started, and the process is ongoing. You can't rewind. One way or another, you will complete your track and reach your individual finale. The only question is **"How"** you will travel this path and what you will gather along the way.

In this context, "Allowance" is like a guide to the game world, a tuning of the game mechanics. It's the set of options that allow you to manipulate what is changeable within the game, a pointer to hidden features, secrets, and unpublicized Easter eggs.

You will write your story and complete the plot regardless. Will it be good or bad? High-quality or not? With comfort or pain? Unlocking your talents or living in the shadows? **The choice is yours.** You can choose _how_ to walk this path.

So, will you use the "developer features" or not? It doesn't matter to anyone but you. No one will impose a style of "play" on you or punish you for your choice. From the perspective of the macrocosm, categories like "good" or "bad" do not exist here. It's all just experience.

Why is it like this? Who designed it? I'm not ready to answer that, as I am still searching myself. Therefore, any choice you make will be accepted as the right one.

So, what will you choose?

Don't answer me.

**Answer yourself.**

### **Your Move, Player**

Life is a game. You are the player. The mission is experience. The plot is malleable.

You choose which path to take. No one is calling you or obligating you to do anything. You have a choice. Make it. There is no "wrong" decision.

_**Is this the end of the publication? Or the beginning of your new journey?**_

The teacher appears when the student is ready. I can point you in a direction, give you a hint on where to look, what to read, what to ask. But you must find what you're looking for on your own. This cannot be explained academically. It can only be lived.
