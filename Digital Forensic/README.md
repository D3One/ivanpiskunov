# Digital Forensics Portfolio & Learning Repository

## 📖 Overview

This repository serves as a comprehensive collection of my practical work, notes, and analytical exercises in **digital forensics and incident response (DFIR)**. Created during my professional training and self-study journey, it encapsulates hands-on investigations, command references, forensic methodology implementations, and technical write-ups from various forensic scenarios. Initially intended as a personal knowledge base, I've open-sourced these materials to help others entering the field and to contribute to the DFIR community.
