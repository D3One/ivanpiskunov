# 15-Year Cybersecurity Career Journey: from newbie to CISO and Startup Owner

## TL;DR
A story of relentless (self)learning, certifications, mastering different cybersecurity domains (Malware, Pentesting, DevSecOps, AppSec), and the mindset shifts that led me from a rookie in Irkutsk to launching my own tech startup.

## What is this article about?
This isn't just my story; it's a roadmap. I'm sharing my journey, complete with proof and resources, to show you what's possible with dedication and to offer guidance for your own path.

## Why did I write this publication?
This post does not encourage you to buy anything. I am not self-promoting, I do not need cheap fame, and I have nothing to prove to anyone. I remember myself 15 years ago and I know how important support is at the start, during difficult moments, and at life's turning points. I want to show a real example through my own case of how a guy from a small Siberian town, from a poor family, and through difficult times was able to rise up, going from a hired entry-level employee to someone creating value and making a personal contribution to the world.

Work pays off, dreams become reality! This story is like a spark in the darkness, a ray of light, a sip of motivation and inspiration in a cramped concrete jungle. Wherever you have been and wherever you started, you can achieve everything you allow yourself to imagine!

**I HAVE DONE IT - YOU CAN TOO!**
