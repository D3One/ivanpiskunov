* **Family:** fast‑track reunification; spouses typically gain direct work access
* **Mobility:** simplified **intra‑EU** move after **12 months** in the first country

## Pitfalls & pro tips

* **Just‑below salary** → refusals; build a buffer for mid‑year updates
* **Mismatch** (role vs. credentials) → denials; ensure a clear skills‑to‑duties mapping
* **Early employer switch** → notification/approval rules apply (country‑specific)
* **Mobility timing** → plan the **12‑month** mark if relocating within EU
* **Non‑participant states** → **Denmark & Ireland** are outside the scheme

## Why clients pick Blue Card

* **Speed to work** vs. achievement‑heavy visas (e.g., US EB‑1/NIW)
* **EU mobility** after a year
* **Family work access** in many states
