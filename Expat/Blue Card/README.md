# EU Blue Card (2025)

## In plain English

The EU Blue Card is the European Union’s work-and-residence permit for **highly qualified** non-EU professionals. It requires a **6-month+** job contract that **matches your qualifications** and meets each country’s **minimum salary threshold** (typically between **1.0× and 1.6×** that country’s average salary). You get fast-track family benefits, the right to change employers with some conditions, EU-wide mobility after **12 months**, and a pathway to long-term residence. Denmark and Ireland don’t participate. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

---

## Quick take: Who it’s for

* Professionals with a **bachelor’s+** (or sector-specific experience) + a **qualified job offer** in an EU country.
* Especially attractive if you may relocate within the EU later (e.g., Germany → Netherlands) thanks to **intra-EU mobility** rules. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

---

## Eligibility framework (two-step analysis)

**Step 1 — “Highly qualified” profile**

* A **higher-education diploma** (normally ≥3 years), **or**
* **Equivalent professional experience** in specific sectors; the recast explicitly allows **experience-based** qualification in areas like IT/ICT. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

**Step 2 — Job & salary**

* **Binding job offer/contract ≥ 6 months** for **highly qualified employment** that aligns with your field.
* **Salary threshold** at or above the **national minimum** for Blue Card (set within **1.0–1.6×** average salary; some countries publish distinct figures for shortage occupations or recent graduates). ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

---

## Key features you actually feel

* **Validity:** Issued up to **4 years** (often “contract length + 3 months”). Renewable. (Example—Germany explains the 4-year cap.) ([Make it in Germany][2])
* **Faster family reunification** with immediate labor-market access for family members in many countries. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
* **Change of employer:** Allowed with notification rules (country-specific). Netherlands, e.g., details search periods if you become unemployed. ([IND][3])
* **Intra-EU mobility:** Move to a second EU country after **12 months** in the first, under simplified rules. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
* **PR track:** Time on a Blue Card counts toward **EU long-term resident** status; some countries (e.g., Germany) offer **earlier national permanent residence** (21–27 months with language). ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

## Salary thresholds at a glance (2025 examples)

> These numbers are **country-specific** and update regularly—always check the national authority.

* **Germany:** General minimum **€48,300**; shortage occupations & new entrants **€43,759.80**. IT pros may qualify **without a degree** with ≥3 years recent experience, if salary meets the lower threshold. ([Make it in Germany][2])
* **Netherlands:** 2025 required monthly amount for EU Blue Card **€5,688** (gross; IND also lists “reduced” thresholds for specific cases). Recognized sponsor **not required** for Blue Card (unlike the “highly skilled migrant” route). ([IND][4])
* **France:** “Carte bleue européenne” requires a **6-month** contract and **€59,373** minimum annual gross pay (2025), plus degree (or experience per the recast). ([Service Public][5])
* **Portugal:** Contract ≥ **6 months** and **≥1.5×** national average gross salary (or **≥1.2×** in specific cases set by law). ([AIMA][6])
* **Poland:** Law sets **≥150%** of the previous year’s national average wage for Blue Card salaries. ([ISAP][7])
* **EU-level rule of thumb:** Member States must set their threshold between **1.0× and 1.6×** national average salary. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

## Step-by-step: How to get it

1. **Match** your degree/experience to a **qualified role** and secure a **6-month+** contract meeting the salary bar. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
2. **Confirm country rules** (regulated professions, salary tables, sponsor status, processing times). Examples: Germany’s “Make it in Germany,” Netherlands IND, France Service-Public. ([Make it in Germany][2])
3. **Apply** at the consulate or in-country authority (varies). IND (NL) shows **30–90 days** timelines depending on case type. ([IND][3])
4. **Register & pick up** your residence card; complete any local steps (address registration, insurance, licensing if regulated).
5. **Bring family** under fast-track family rules where applicable. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

---

## Document checklist (core set)

* Signed **employment contract/offer** (≥6 months) showing **title, duties, salary**. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
* **Diploma** (or documented **professional experience** per sector rules; NL accepts 5 years, or 3 years for IT in last 7). ([IND][3])
* **Passport**, **biometric photo**, **proof of health insurance**, **proof of lodging/registration** (country-specific). (See NL and DE exemplars.) ([IND][3])
* **Professional license/recognition** when the occupation is **regulated**. ([IND][3])

---

## Country snapshots (2025)

* **Germany** — Blue Card up to **4 years**; **settlement permit** in **27 months** (or **21 months** with B1). IT pros can qualify **without a formal degree** with 3 years recent experience if salary threshold is met. ([Make it in Germany][2])
* **Netherlands** — Blue Card vs. “highly skilled migrant”: Blue Card **doesn’t require** a recognized sponsor but has **higher pay** bars; IND publishes **2025 amounts** and **30-day** decisions for some cases. ([IND][3])
* **France** — “Carte bleue européenne” under the Talent Passport system: **€59,373** min pay, **6-month** contract, degree or experience; validity tied to contract, capped at **4 years**. ([Service Public][5])
* **Spain** — Processed by national migration units (e.g., **UGE**); requires **highly qualified** role, **6-month** contract, and salary meeting the national Blue Card floor. Check UGE guidance for forms and channels. ([Inclusion][8])
* **Portugal** — Contract ≥ **6 months** and salary **≥1.5×** average (or **≥1.2×** in specified cases). AIMA provides forms and guidance. ([AIMA][6])
* **Poland** — Blue Card law implements **≥150%** average wage as the minimum salary; check the latest “Monitor Polski” figures when budgeting offers. ([ISAP][7])

(Blue Card’s strength is **speed to work** + **EU mobility**; EB-1/NIW excel where the **candidate’s record** is the asset.)

## Common pitfalls & pro tips

* **Salary misses the mark:** Offers **just below** the threshold fail. Build in cushion for mid-year updates. (Member States publish annual tables.) ([IND][4])
* **Job–qualification mismatch:** Role must align with your degree/experience; regulated professions often need **recognition or licensing**. ([IND][3])
* **Switching employers too soon:** Some countries require **notification/approval** if changing in the first year. Plan timing. ([IND][3])
* **Counting on Ireland/Denmark:** They’re **outside** the scheme. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
* **Ignoring mobility timing:** You generally need **12 months** in the first Member State before moving. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

---

## FAQ (short answers)

* **Can I qualify without a degree?**
  In ICT and certain sectors, **experience can substitute** for a degree under the recast rules (country-specific proof required). ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

* **How long is the card valid?**
  Often **up to 4 years** (or the contract term + a short buffer). Germany explicitly states this cap. ([Make it in Germany][2])

* **When can I move to another EU country?**
  After **12 months** in your first Blue Card country, under simplified procedures. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])

* **What about permanent residence?**
  Blue Card time usually **counts** toward **EU long-term resident** status; some countries (e.g., Germany) offer **accelerated national PR** with language. ([Migration and Home Affairs][1])
