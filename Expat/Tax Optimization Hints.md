### Critical Considerations Beyond the Tax Rate

Selecting a jurisdiction should not be based on tax rates alone. Key factors for a thorough due diligence process include:
*   **Double Taxation Agreements (DTAs):** A strong treaty network can prevent your profits from being taxed twice.
*   **Regulatory Compliance:** Adherence to global standards like the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) framework is crucial to avoid reputational damage and penalties.
*   **Reputation:** The jurisdiction's standing on international watchlists (e.g., FATF, EU Greylist) can affect banking and business relations.
*   **Economic Substance Requirements:** Many low-tax jurisdictions now require companies to demonstrate real operational activity locally, not just a registered address.

### Conclusion

Choosing where to register a company is a complex decision with long-term implications. While the jurisdictions listed offer compelling advantages, the "best" choice is entirely dependent on your business model, target markets, and long-term goals. It is highly recommended to consult with international tax advisors and legal counsel to structure your business in a way that is both optimized and fully compliant with global regulations.
