Since 2016, he has been a regular contributor to Hacker magazine[3]. In the same year, he launched his personal blog on the Blogger platform[1], where he actively developed the topic of information security. His first publications on information security began to appear in 2014 on the Anti-Malware portal[5]. In 2018, he launched his own Telegram channel, “White2Hack,” dedicated to information security issues for a wide range of people[3]. After working for several years at various software development companies, he began to work closely with Kubernetes (K8s) and actively immerse himself in DevOps security issues, resulting in the publication of his book “Kubernetes security. Guide for beginners from zero to hero”[2] in mid-2021, written entirely in English. At the same time, he launched another author's blog aimed at Western readers on Medium[4], and then on Dev.to[9] and Security Exchange[10].
