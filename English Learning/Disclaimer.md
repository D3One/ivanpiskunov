## **Disclaimer on Copyright and Supporting Authors**

#### **1. Introduction and Purpose of the Repository**

This repository is a personal collection of resources I used during my English learning journey. I firmly believe that English is a window to the world, offering new opportunities for career advancement, travel, professional growth, and personal development. My goal is to share this curated list of publicly accessible and freely distributed materials to help other learners. This repository is intended for educational purposes only.

#### **2. Stance Against Digital Piracy and Respect for Copyright**

I am unequivocally against digital piracy and do not support the infringement of intellectual property rights. All books, software, and other materials protected by copyright that are distributed on a commercial basis must be rightfully purchased from the official authors or publishers.

*   **For Legally Protected Materials:** Any copyrighted material in this repository that is commercially distributed is intended for preliminary review only. Readers and users are obligated to purchase a legitimate copy no later than five (5) days after accessing the digital version. After this period, you must delete the downloaded copy and acquire the work through legal channels.
*   **For Public Domain & Freely Licensed Materials:** This repository also contains materials that the authors themselves have made public, are in the public domain, or are distributed under licenses that permit free sharing and copying. I strive to include only such materials where specific permission for distribution has been granted.

#### **3. A Personal Note from a Fellow Creator**

As an author who has published several books, pamphlets, and collections, I understand the immense effort, time, and dedication involved in the creative and publishing process. I deeply value, respect, and support this labor. I believe that supporting legal methods of content distribution is fundamental to a healthy and sustainable creative ecosystem.

#### **4. The Importance of Supporting Authors and Publishers**

Purchasing a licensed copy is not just a legal formality; it is a direct vote of support for the author and publisher. This support:
*   **Funds Future Work:** It financially rewards the creator for their labor, enabling them to continue producing high-quality content.
*   **Sustains Development:** It supports the ongoing development, improvement, and updating of the product.
*   **Encourages Excellence:** It stimulates the market for quality work and encourages authors and publishers to create more.

#### **5. Final Call to Action: Invest in Quality**

By choosing to buy only the best, high-quality, licensed products, you do more than just acquire a resourceâ€”you express gratitude for the work and respect the creator's effort. Valuing the work of others is a principle that, in turn, ensures your own work will be recognized and valued in the future.

**Respect the work. Support the creators. Buy legal copies.**
