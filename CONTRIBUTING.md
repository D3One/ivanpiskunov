Thanks for improving the Innovator Founder Ops Kit. Keep it concise and practical.

## Ground Rules
- **Stay factual.** Cite GOV.UK or other official sources when you change requirements/fees.
- **Keep placeholders.** Use `{{like-this}}` for variables users can fill in.
- **No personal data** or proprietary docs in examples.

## How to Propose Changes
1. Fork the repo and create a feature branch:  
   `git checkout -b docs/update-ilr-examples`
2. Make small, focused commits.
3. Open a PR with:
   - **What changed** (1–2 lines)
   - **Why** (what problem it solves)
   - **Source links** (if rules/fees/process changed)

## Commit Message Style (Conventional Commits)
- `docs: add export evidence examples to ILR tracker`
- `feat: add template for EB follow-up email`
- `chore: tidy headings and anchors`

## File & Link Hygiene
- Keep files under `/ops/` for operational docs.
- Use relative links: `./ops/ilr-tracker.md`
- Store sample proofs under `/evidence/` in your own private repo (don’t commit real financials).
