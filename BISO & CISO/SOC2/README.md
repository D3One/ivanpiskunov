# Technical and Administrative Measures to Achieve SOC 2 Compliance

## Abstract

This comprehensive article examines the **technical and administrative controls** organizations must implement to meet the rigorous requirements of the SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) compliance framework. Developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA), SOC 2 provides criteria for managing customer data based on five **Trust Services Criteria**: security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy. Unlike prescribed compliance frameworks, SOC 2 allows organizations to design customized controls that align with their specific operations while still meeting the framework's rigorous requirements. This paper details specific implementation measures across operating systems, network infrastructure, access management, data protection, and administrative policies, providing a roadmap for organizations seeking to achieve and maintain SOC 2 compliance. The article also differentiates between Type I and Type II reports, offering guidance on implementation strategies that satisfy the more comprehensive Type II requirements that examine operational effectiveness over time.

## 1 Introduction to SOC 2

### 1.1 What is SOC 2?

SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls 2) is a **voluntary compliance standard** developed by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) that establishes guidelines for service organizations to securely manage and protect customer data. Unlike regulatory requirements such as HIPAA or GDPR, SOC 2 compliance is not mandated by law but has become an **industry expectation** for technology companies, cloud providers, and any service organization that handles client information . The framework is specifically designed for service providers that store, process, or transmit customer data in the cloud, making it particularly relevant for SaaS companies, data centers, managed service providers, and other technology-enabled service organizations .

The SOC 2 framework is based on five **Trust Services Criteria** (TSCs)—security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy—which form the foundation for evaluating an organization's controls . Each principle addresses a different aspect of data protection and management, with security being the only mandatory principle for all SOC 2 reports. Organizations can select which of the remaining principles are relevant to their services and customer expectations, allowing for a tailored approach to compliance that reflects their specific business operations and risk environment .

### 1.2 Importance and Business Value

SOC 2 compliance provides significant **business advantages** beyond mere certification. In today's increasingly regulated digital economy, demonstrating robust security practices has become a **competitive differentiator** that can open doors to enterprise customers, particularly in regulated industries such as finance, healthcare, and government contracting . Many large organizations now require their vendors to provide SOC 2 reports as part of the vendor due diligence process, making compliance essential for market access and business development .

From an internal perspective, the process of achieving SOC 2 compliance helps organizations establish **mature security practices** and systematic risk management approaches. Companies that undergo the SOC 2 audit process typically identify gaps in their security posture, streamline documentation practices, and implement more consistent operational procedures . The framework encourages organizations to develop comprehensive security policies, implement rigorous access controls, and establish incident response protocols—all of which contribute to reduced security risks and potential cost savings from avoided data breaches .

### 1.3 Types of SOC 2 Reports

Organizations pursuing SOC 2 compliance can obtain two different types of reports, each serving different purposes and providing varying levels of assurance:

- **Type I**: This report evaluates the suitability of the **design of controls** at a specific point in time. It answers whether the organization has implemented appropriate controls that are properly designed to meet the Trust Services Criteria . Type I reports are typically faster to achieve and serve as a preliminary step toward full compliance, though many enterprise customers now prefer or require Type II reports .

- **Type II**: This more comprehensive report examines the **operational effectiveness** of controls over a period of time, typically ranging from 3 to 12 months . Type II reports provide greater assurance to customers and stakeholders as they demonstrate that controls not only exist but function effectively over time. Most organizations start with a Type I report and then progress to Type II, though increasingly companies are opting to go directly for Type II certification to meet customer expectations .

*Table: Comparison of SOC 2 Report Types*

| **Aspect** | **Type I** | **Type II** |
|------------|------------|------------|
| **Focus** | Design of controls | Operational effectiveness of controls |
| **Timeframe** | Single point in time | 3-12 month period |
| **Level of Assurance** | Basic | Comprehensive |
| **Customer Perception** | Preliminary step | Preferred standard |
| **Typical Use Case** | Initial compliance effort | Mature security program |

## 2 SOC 2 Framework Core Components

### 2.1 Trust Services Criteria

The SOC 2 framework is built upon five **Trust Services Criteria** (TSCs) that represent the core principles organizations must address through their controls. While security is mandatory for all SOC 2 reports, organizations can select which of the remaining criteria are relevant to their services and customer expectations . Each criterion addresses a specific aspect of data protection and management:

- **Security**: The foundation of SOC 2 compliance, this principle addresses protection of system resources against **unauthorized access**. Security controls prevent potential system abuse, theft or unauthorized removal of data, misuse of software, and improper alteration or disclosure of information . IT security tools such as network and web application firewalls (WAFs), two-factor authentication, and intrusion detection are essential for preventing security breaches that can lead to unauthorized access of systems and data .

- **Availability**: This principle refers to the **accessibility** of the system, products, or services as stipulated by a contract or service level agreement (SLA) . The minimum acceptable performance level for system availability is set by both parties, and involves security-related criteria that may affect availability. Monitoring network performance and availability, site failover, and security incident handling are critical components of meeting availability requirements .

- **Processing Integrity**: This principle addresses whether a system achieves its purpose by delivering the **right data at the right price at the right time** . Data processing must be complete, valid, accurate, timely, and authorized. However, processing integrity does not necessarily imply data integrity—if data contains errors prior to being input into the system, detecting them is not usually the responsibility of the processing entity .

- **Confidentiality**: Data is considered confidential if its access and disclosure is restricted to a specified set of persons or organizations . Examples may include data intended only for company personnel, business plans, intellectual property, internal price lists, and other types of sensitive financial information. Encryption is an important control for protecting confidentiality during transmission, while network and application firewalls together with rigorous access controls safeguard information being processed or stored on computer systems .

- **Privacy**: The privacy principle addresses the system's collection, use, retention, disclosure, and disposal of **personal information** in conformity with an organization's privacy notice, as well as with criteria set forth in the AICPA's generally accepted privacy principles (GAPP) . Personal identifiable information (PII) refers to details that can distinguish an individual (e.g., name, address, Social Security number). Some personal data related to health, race, sexuality, and religion is considered sensitive and generally requires an extra level of protection .

### 2.2 Scope and Applicability

SOC 2 compliance is particularly relevant for **service organizations** that process or store sensitive data on behalf of their clients. This includes SaaS companies, cloud computing providers, data centers, managed service providers, and any organization that handles customer data in cloud environments . The framework applies to both the technical infrastructure and organizational processes that support the security, availability, and processing integrity of customer data.

The scope of a SOC 2 examination is determined by the organization itself in consultation with stakeholders and auditors. Organizations must define their **system boundaries**—the infrastructure, software, people, procedures, and data that are relevant to the services provided to customers . This boundary definition is critical as it determines which components will be included in the audit and which trust services criteria are applicable to the organization's services.

*Table: SOC 2 Applicability by Organization Type*

| **Organization Type** | **Typically Relevant TSCs** | **Common Implementation Focus Areas** |
|-----------------------|------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **SaaS Providers** | Security, Availability, Confidentiality | Access controls, encryption, backup procedures |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | Security, Availability, Processing Integrity | Network security, monitoring, change management |
| **Data Processing** | Security, Processing Integrity, Privacy | Data validation, encryption, privacy controls |
| **Managed Services** | Security, Availability, Confidentiality | Access management, incident response, monitoring |

## 3 Technical Implementation Measures

### 3.1 Operating System Security

Implementing robust **OS security controls** is fundamental to meeting SOC 2 requirements, particularly the security and confidentiality principles. For Windows environments, organizations should implement BitLocker encryption for full disk protection, implement Microsoft Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP) for endpoint security, and configure Windows Defender Firewall with advanced security rules . Least privilege principles should be enforced through carefully configured User Account Control (UAC) settings and administrative privilege management.

For **Linux systems**, organizations should implement mandatory access control frameworks such as SELinux or AppArmor, configure robust iptables or firewalld rulesets, and ensure timely security patching through automated update mechanisms. System hardening should follow industry standards such as CIS Benchmarks, with particular attention to securing SSH configurations, removing unnecessary services, and implementing comprehensive auditing through auditd . Both Windows and Linux systems should have host-based intrusion detection systems (HIDS) implemented to monitor for suspicious activities and configuration changes.

File integrity monitoring (FIM) should be deployed across all critical systems to detect unauthorized changes to configuration files, binaries, and critical data. This capability is essential for demonstrating compliance with the security principle and detecting potential security incidents . Additionally, organizations should implement centralized logging with consistent time synchronization across all systems to enable effective security monitoring and incident investigation.

### 3.2 Network Security Controls

**Network protection mechanisms** form a critical layer of defense for SOC 2 compliance, particularly for the security and availability principles. Organizations should implement next-generation firewalls with intrusion prevention capabilities at network boundaries, configured with default-deny rulesets that only permit explicitly authorized traffic . Network segmentation should be employed to isolate sensitive systems and data, with VLANs or software-defined networking technologies used to enforce separation between production environments, development networks, and corporate systems .

Web application firewalls (WAFs) should be deployed to protect internet-facing applications from common attack vectors such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities . For organizations handling sensitive data, **encryption in transit** is mandatory—TLS 1.2 or higher should be enforced for all network communications, with strong cipher suites and regular certificate management processes .

Network availability requirements under SOC 2 necessitate implementing redundant network infrastructure, including redundant internet connections from diverse providers where possible . Organizations should implement network monitoring solutions that provide comprehensive visibility into traffic patterns, bandwidth utilization, and potential security incidents. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) protection mechanisms should be employed to maintain availability against volumetric attacks .

### 3.3 Access Management Systems

Implementing comprehensive **access control mechanisms** is essential for SOC 2 compliance, particularly for the security and confidentiality principles. Organizations should implement role-based access control (RBAC) systems that enforce the principle of least privilege, ensuring users only have access to the resources necessary for their job functions . Access reviews should be conducted regularly—typically quarterly for privileged users and annually for standard users—to ensure access rights remain appropriate as roles change .

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) should be mandatory for all user accounts, particularly for administrative access, remote access, and access to sensitive systems or data . Adaptive authentication mechanisms that consider contextual factors such as user location, device security posture, and accessed resources can provide additional security while maintaining usability .

For organizations managing complex environments, **privileged access management** (PAM) solutions should be implemented to control, monitor, and secure access to critical systems. PAM solutions should enforce just-in-time access principles, require justification for privileged access, and record all privileged sessions for audit purposes . Additionally, organizations should implement automated user provisioning and deprovisioning processes that promptly remove access when employees change roles or leave the organization .

### 3.4 Data Encryption and Protection

**Encryption implementations** are critical for meeting the confidentiality and privacy principles of SOC 2. Organizations should implement encryption both in transit and at rest for all sensitive data, using strong cryptographic algorithms and robust key management practices . For data in transit, TLS 1.2 or higher should be standard, with perfect forward secrecy configurations where appropriate. For data at rest, AES-256 encryption should be employed for sensitive data stored in databases, file systems, and backup media .

**Key management** is equally important as the encryption itself. Organizations should implement secure key management solutions that separate cryptographic keys from encrypted data, enforce regular key rotation policies, and maintain secure key backup procedures . For cloud environments, organizations should leverage cloud-native key management services such as AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, or Google Cloud KMS, while ensuring appropriate access controls and auditing are implemented for these sensitive services.

Data loss prevention (DLP) solutions should be deployed to monitor and control data movement, preventing unauthorized transmission of sensitive information . These solutions should be configured to detect sensitive data patterns such as credit card numbers, social security numbers, and other confidential information, with policies aligned to the organization's data classification scheme. Additionally, organizations should implement digital rights management (DRM) solutions for particularly sensitive documents to maintain control over data even after it has been distributed to authorized recipients.

### 3.5 Backup and Availability Solutions

**Comprehensive backup strategies** are essential for meeting SOC 2 availability and processing integrity requirements. Organizations should implement the 3-2-1 backup rule: maintain at least three copies of data, store copies on two different media types, and keep one copy offsite . Backup solutions should include both system-level backups for disaster recovery and application-level backups for data restoration, with regular testing to verify backup integrity and restoration procedures.

For critical systems, **high availability architectures** should be implemented to minimize downtime and ensure business continuity. This may include database clustering, load-balanced application servers, and geographically distributed infrastructure for regional failover capabilities . Organizations should establish clear Recovery Time Objectives (RTO) and Recovery Point Objectives (RPO) for each system based on business requirements, with technical solutions aligned to these objectives.

Backup encryption is mandatory for protecting confidential data in backup systems, with access to backup media strictly controlled and monitored . Organizations should implement immutable backup solutions where possible to protect against ransomware attacks that specifically target backup systems. Backup monitoring should include verification of backup completion, regular test restorations, and alerting for backup failures to ensure data protection measures remain effective over time.

## 4 Administrative Implementation Measures

### 4.1 Policy Development and Documentation

**Comprehensive documentation** forms the foundation of SOC 2 compliance, demonstrating the organization's commitment to formalized processes and consistent operations . Organizations should develop a suite of security policies that address all relevant Trust Services Criteria, including an Information Security Policy, Access Control Policy, Incident Response Policy, Business Continuity Plan, and Acceptable Use Policy . Each policy should be reviewed and approved at the executive level, then regularly updated to reflect changes in the threat landscape or business operations.

**Procedure documentation** should provide detailed guidance for implementing policy requirements, with step-by-step instructions for recurring security activities such as user access reviews, system hardening, incident response, and backup verification . Organizations should maintain an inventory of all systems in scope for SOC 2 compliance, including documentation of system functions, data flows, and ownership responsibilities. This system description becomes a critical component of the SOC 2 report, providing context for auditors to understand the organization's control environment .

All policies and procedures should be made accessible to relevant personnel, with version control mechanisms to ensure employees are always working with current documentation . Organizations should implement document retention policies that define how long different types of documentation should be maintained, with secure archival processes for documentation that may be needed for audit or investigative purposes.

### 4.2 Risk Assessment and Management

**Formalized risk assessment** processes are essential for SOC 2 compliance, enabling organizations to identify, prioritize, and address risks to their systems and data . Organizations should conduct regular risk assessments—at least annually or when significant changes occur—that evaluate threats, vulnerabilities, and potential business impacts. Risk assessment methodologies should be standardized and repeatable, with criteria established for evaluating risk levels based on likelihood and impact factors.

**Risk treatment plans** should document how identified risks will be addressed, whether through mitigation, acceptance, transfer, or avoidance . Organizations should maintain a risk register that tracks identified risks, treatment decisions, and mitigation progress, with regular reporting to executive management and the board of directors. This risk register becomes a key artifact for SOC 2 audits, demonstrating the organization's systematic approach to risk management.

Third-party risk management is particularly important for SOC 2 compliance, as organizations must ensure that vendors and partners who handle their data maintain appropriate security controls . Organizations should implement vendor assessment processes that evaluate security practices of critical vendors, with requirements for vendors to provide their own SOC 2 reports or complete security questionnaires. Contractual agreements with vendors should include security requirements and right-to-audit clauses where appropriate.

### 4.3 Employee Training and Awareness

**Security awareness programs** are critical for establishing a security-conscious culture and ensuring employees understand their responsibilities for protecting organizational assets . Organizations should implement comprehensive training programs that cover security policies, secure handling of sensitive data, recognition of social engineering attacks, and incident reporting procedures. Training should be mandatory for all employees, with specialized content for roles with additional security responsibilities such system administrators or developers.

**Phishing simulation exercises** should be conducted regularly to test employee awareness and reinforce training concepts . These simulations should be accompanied by immediate feedback and additional training for employees who fall victim to simulated attacks. Organizations should track training completion and awareness metrics to demonstrate program effectiveness to auditors and identify areas for improvement.

Role-specific training should be provided for technical staff responsible for implementing and maintaining security controls . This may include secure coding training for developers, system hardening training for administrators, and security assessment training for architects. Organizations should encourage professional certification for technical staff, such as CISSP, CISM, or vendor-specific qualifications, to ensure maintenance of current skills and knowledge.

### 4.4 Incident Response Planning

**Formal incident response capabilities** are mandatory for SOC 2 compliance, demonstrating the organization's preparedness to handle security incidents effectively . Organizations should develop comprehensive incident response plans that define roles and responsibilities, declaration criteria, escalation procedures, and communication protocols. The plan should address various incident types including data breaches, denial of service attacks, ransomware infections, and insider threats .

**Incident response testing** through tabletop exercises should be conducted regularly—at least annually—to validate plans and ensure response team members understand their responsibilities . These exercises should simulate realistic attack scenarios based on the organization's threat landscape, with after-action reviews identifying lessons learned and improvement opportunities. Organizations should maintain incident response kits with necessary tools, contact lists, and documentation to support efficient response during actual incidents.

Communication plans should address both internal and external stakeholders, including customers, partners, regulatory bodies, and law enforcement where appropriate . Organizations should consider pre-drafting notification templates for various incident scenarios to enable timely communications while ensuring regulatory requirements are met. Incident documentation processes should capture timeline, actions taken, and lessons learned to support post-incident analysis and potential legal requirements.

### 4.5 Vendor Risk Management

**Third-party risk management** is increasingly important as organizations rely on external vendors for critical services and infrastructure . Organizations should maintain a complete inventory of vendors that handle sensitive data or provide critical services, with risk assessments conducted for each vendor based on the sensitivity of data accessed and criticality of services provided . Vendor contracts should explicitly include security requirements, data protection obligations, and right-to-audit clauses where appropriate.

**Due diligence processes** should be established for vendor selection, requiring potential vendors to provide SOC 2 reports, complete security questionnaires, or undergo security assessments before engagement . Organizations should establish minimum security requirements for vendors based on the sensitivity of data being shared or services being provided, with requirements escalating based on risk levels.

Ongoing monitoring of vendor security practices should include regular review of vendor SOC 2 reports, security attestations, or penetration test results . Organizations should establish processes for addressing vendor security incidents, including notification requirements and escalation procedures. For critical vendors, organizations should consider conducting periodic on-site assessments or reviewing audit working papers to validate control effectiveness.

## 5 Implementation Methodology

### 5.1 Gap Assessment and Readiness

**Initial gap assessments** are critical for organizations beginning their SOC 2 compliance journey, providing a clear understanding of current state versus requirements . Organizations should conduct comprehensive assessments that evaluate people, processes, and technologies against all relevant Trust Services Criteria, with particular focus on the security principle which is mandatory for all SOC 2 reports . Assessments should be conducted by qualified internal or external resources with specific SOC 2 expertise to ensure accurate identification of gaps and realistic effort estimation.

**Remediation prioritization** should be based on risk assessment, with critical gaps addressed first to reduce significant risks while demonstrating progress toward compliance . Organizations should develop detailed remediation plans with assigned owners, target dates, and regular status reporting to executive management. Project management offices or dedicated program managers should be established to coordinate remediation activities across multiple teams and ensure timely completion.

Readiness assessments should be conducted approximately 3-6 months before the formal audit to identify any remaining gaps and ensure adequate time for remediation . These assessments typically involve mock audits conducted by internal audit teams or external consultants, providing practice for the formal audit and identifying any process or documentation issues that need addressing before the actual examination.

### 5.2 Continuous Monitoring and Improvement

**Ongoing monitoring capabilities** are essential for maintaining SOC 2 compliance between audits and demonstrating operational effectiveness for Type II reports . Organizations should implement security monitoring solutions that provide comprehensive visibility across systems, networks, and applications, with alerting configured for suspicious activities or control failures . Log management and analysis solutions should aggregate logs from all critical systems, with retention periods aligned to regulatory requirements and business needs.

**Key risk indicators** (KRIs) and **key control indicators** (KCIs) should be established to monitor control effectiveness and identify potential issues before they result in control failures . These metrics should be regularly reported to management with escalation procedures for metrics that fall outside acceptable ranges. Organizations should implement automated control testing where possible to continuously validate control operation and reduce manual testing efforts.

Continuous improvement processes should include regular review of controls, policies, and procedures to identify optimization opportunities . Organizations should establish feedback mechanisms for control operators to suggest improvements based on their operational experience. Changes to controls should follow formal change management processes with appropriate testing and documentation to maintain audit trails.

### 5.3 Audit Preparation and Execution

**Audit preparation activities** should begin well before the actual examination period, particularly for initial SOC 2 audits . Organizations should develop evidence collection procedures and repositories to streamline the audit process, with clear documentation of control objectives, control activities, and evidence sources . Pre-audit workshops should be conducted with process and control owners to prepare them for auditor interactions and ensure consistent understanding of control objectives and operations.

**Auditor management** is an important aspect of successful SOC 2 examinations . Organizations should establish clear points of contact for auditors, provide secure methods for evidence sharing, and maintain issue logs to track auditor questions and organizational responses. Regular status meetings should be conducted throughout the audit process to address issues promptly and maintain audit momentum.

Post-audit activities should include management reviews of audit findings, development of remediation plans for any identified deficiencies, and incorporation of lessons learned into the ongoing compliance program . Organizations should conduct their own assessment of the audit process to identify improvements for subsequent examinations, particularly for organizations pursuing Type II reports that will require annual audits.

## 6 Conclusion

Achieving and maintaining SOC 2 compliance requires a comprehensive approach that addresses technical controls, administrative policies, and organizational processes. By implementing the measures outlined in this article—ranging from technical security controls across operating systems and networks to administrative policies for risk management and incident response—organizations can establish a robust control environment that meets SOC 2 requirements while genuinely enhancing their security posture.

The journey to SOC 2 compliance requires significant effort but delivers substantial business value through enhanced customer trust, competitive differentiation, and improved security practices. Organizations should view SOC 2 not as a one-time compliance exercise but as an ongoing commitment to security excellence that evolves with changing threats, technologies, and business requirements. By embracing the principles underlying the SOC 2 framework, organizations can build a culture of security that protects both their interests and those of their customers.
