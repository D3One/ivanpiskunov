# Part I — Dopamine Detox (Book 1)

### <a id="theory-dd"></a>Theory

**Core idea**: Modern digital life saturates us with high‑dopamine, low‑value stimuli (infinite feeds, push notifications, snackable content). That raises the **reward threshold** and makes effortful, high‑value work feel dull. A *detox* reduces the baseline stimulation so that deliberate, deep work becomes intrinsically rewarding again.

**Mechanics**

* **Dopamine as incentive salience**: not simple “pleasure hormone,” but a signal that *motivates pursuit*. Repeated high‑reward micro‑bursts (scroll, ping, click) train compulsive loops.
* **Cue → Craving → Response → Reward**: the habit loop is strengthened by variable rewards (unpredictable likes/messages).
* **Friction and default**: Availability and defaults decide 80% of behavior. Design your environment so *deep work is the easiest path*.

**Expected benefits**

* Lowered distraction baseline, increased tolerance for boredom, faster task engagement, improved sustained attention, calmer affect.

### <a id="practice-dd"></a>7‑Day Protocol (Practice)

**Day 1 — Audit & Baseline**

* List top 10 distracting apps/sites; capture trigger times/contexts; measure screen time, notifications/day.
* Identify your **High‑Value Tasks (HVTs)** for the week.

**Day 2 — Remove Triggers**

* Delete/disable entertainment apps on phone; log out of social media on desktop; remove dock icons; block sites (hosts file/extension).
* Move phone out of reach; set grayscale mode; disable *all* non‑critical notifications.

**Day 3 — Rewire Defaults**

* Set a **One‑Tap Deep Work** environment: open editor/repo; close mail/Slack; full‑screen; timer pre‑set (25–50 min).
* Put a paper checklist on desk: *Start block → No notifications → Finish line*.

**Day 4 — Replacement Activities**

* Create “urge‑surfing” menu: 3‑min breath reset, 10 bodyweight squats, 1 lap around room, pour water, write next line of code.
* Replace idle browsing with **active rest** (walk, stretch, quick tidy).

**Day 5 — Deep Work Expansion**

* Run 3 focus blocks (25–50 min) separated by 5–10‑min movement breaks; one longer break after 4 blocks.
* Record **Task Start Latency (TSL)** and **distraction count** per block.

**Day 6 — Social Boundaries**

* Batch email/DM checks 2–3×/day.
* Use a status line: “Heads down 9:30–11:30 & 2–4; ping for urgent.”

**Day 7 — Consolidation**

* Review metrics (TSL, blocks completed, urges resisted).
* Decide permanent **keystone constraints** (e.g., no phone at desk; default site blocks weekdays).

### <a id="worksheets-dd"></a>Worksheets & Templates

* **Distraction Audit**: App/Site · Trigger · Daily Min · Replace With · Blocked?
* **Deep‑Work Block Log**: Start Time · Focus Length · TSL · Distractions (#) · Finish Line · Notes.

# Part II — Immediate Action (Book 2)

### <a id="theory-ia"></a>Theory

**Core idea**: Procrastination is not laziness; it’s often **ambiguity**, **aversive emotion**, or **mis‑sized tasks**. Make action *trivially easy*, shrink emotional load, and create momentum.

**Mechanics**

* **Emotion regulation** beats willpower: reduce fear/uncertainty, use quick wins.
* **Clarity → Confidence → Action**: define done, first move, and a short path.
* **Action begets motivation**: small steps generate intrinsic motivation (“progress loop”).

### <a id="practice-ia"></a>7‑Day Protocol (Practice)

**Day 1 — Declutter your mind**: Brain‑dump everything; sort into *Do/Defer/Delegate/Drop*.
**Day 2 — Identify why you procrastinate**: Fear, perfectionism, unclear spec, too large, low energy? Label it.
**Day 3 — Deepen understanding**: For each blocker, write a 2‑line *counter‑move* (e.g., “unclear spec → ask X three questions”).
**Day 4 — Gain clarity**: Convert top 3 outcomes into **Definition of Done** (acceptance criteria, owner, deadline).
**Day 5 — Develop laser‑sharp focus**: One HVT before any messages; 2–4 deep blocks; end with “next task primed.”
**Day 6 — Release fear**: Pre‑commit to an *imperfect first draft*; apply 80/20; timebox.
**Day 7 — Routine & consistency**: Fix start times; schedule review; create a visible streak tracker.

### <a id="worksheets-ia"></a>Worksheets & Templates

* **Root‑Cause Map**: Task · Emotion/Blocker · Counter‑Move · First 2‑min Step.
* **Definition of Done (DoD)**: Outcome · Accept. Criteria · Test/Review · Deadline.
* **Streak Tracker**: Date · Start Time · HVT done before inbox? (Y/N)

# Part III — Powerful Focus (Book 3)

### <a id="theory-pf"></a>Theory

**Core idea**: Focus is a skill set: **clarity** (what matters), **context design** (where you work), **attention control** (how you start/maintain), and **energy** (supporting physiology). Build all four.

**Mechanics**

* **Clarity precedes intensity**: Without a tight spec, attention leaks.
* **Trigger design**: visual cues, fixed start rituals, single‑task windows.
* **Friction removal**: pre‑load environments, offline copies, one‑keystroke build/test.

### <a id="practice-pf"></a>7‑Day Protocol (Practice)

**Day 1 — 15 questions to identify what you want** (values, constraints, peak hours).
**Day 2 — Time architecture**: hard‑schedule 2–4 deep blocks/day; set boundaries around them.
**Day 3 — Context design**: declutter desk; app presets; noise strategy (silence, noise, or music).
**Day 4 — Focus triggers**: fixed start ritual (timer on, editor open, notifications off).
**Day 5 — Deep work mechanics**: one task/one window; write finish line at top; log TSL & task switches.
**Day 6 — Energy & variance**: align blocks with peak hours; add movement snacks.
**Day 7 — Eliminate friction**: create makefiles/scripts; template checklists; keep tools cached.

### <a id="worksheets-pf"></a>Worksheets & Templates

* **Clarity Worksheet**: Project · Why it matters · Success criteria · One finish line for today.
* **Block Planner**: Day · Block # · Start/End · HVT · Distraction count · Notes.
* **Friction Audit**: Annoyance · Fix (script/template) · Owner · Done?

# Part IV — Strategic Mindset (Book 4)

### <a id="theory-sm"></a>Theory

**Core idea**: Strategy is **prioritization + sequencing** under constraints. Think in **domino chains** (force multipliers first), run **90‑day outcomes**, and manage energy like a portfolio.

**Mechanics**

* **Effectiveness vs Efficiency**: Doing the right things beats doing more. Kill low‑leverage tasks.
* **Domino principle**: Line up tasks so one success knocks over the next.
* **Quarterly cycles**: Annual direction → 90‑day outcomes → weekly commitments.

### <a id="practice-sm"></a>7‑Day Protocol (Practice)

**Day 1 — Plan your year**: 3–5 directional bets; anti‑goals (what you won’t do).
**Day 2 — Make the dominos fall**: Map dependencies; place lever tasks first.
**Day 3 — Plan your 90 days**: 2–3 outcomes; metrics; owner; constraints.
**Day 4 — Be strategic during your day**: Most important thing (MIT) before noon; block trivial work.
**Day 5 — Think smart**: ask leverage questions (What 20% yields 80%? What if I did the opposite? What if this were easy?).
**Day 6 — Apply what you learn**: capture insights; run tiny experiments; adopt winners.
**Day 7 — Manage energy**: schedule deload weeks; define red‑line symptoms; pre‑plan re‑entry after on‑call/crunch.

### <a id="worksheets-sm"></a>Worksheets & Templates

* **Year Plan Lite**: Bet · Why · Success Metric · Risks · Not Doing.
* **Domino Map**: Target · Prereq · Lever Task · Next Knock‑on.
* **90‑Day Sheet**: Outcome · KPI · Owner · Constraints · Review Date.

## Closing

This document re‑structures the *Productivity Series* into a single, coherent field guide: detox from high‑dopamine noise, convert clarity into immediate action, train powerful focus, and execute strategically over quarters. Copy the templates you need, run a 7‑day cycle in each part, and iterate from real‑world feedback.
