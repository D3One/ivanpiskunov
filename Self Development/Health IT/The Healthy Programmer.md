## Part I — Theory: Why Tech Work Harms Health (and What to Do About It)

### 1) The Risk Model for Knowledge Workers

* **Load + Duration + Posture** drive risk. The hours you sit, the positions you hold, and the forces your tissues bear determine whether you drift toward **overuse**.
* **Monotony** is toxic to tissues and to attention. Repeating the same keystrokes/mouse movements while your spine and shoulders don’t move induces **micro-trauma** and **deconditioning**.
* **Recovery debt** accumulates invisibly: insufficient sleep, hydration, or breaks reduce your tissues’ capacity to handle tomorrow’s workload.

### 2) Key Physiological Targets

* **Eyes**: Computer Vision Syndrome (CVS) arises from reduced blink rate, high visual demand at one focal distance, glare, poor lighting, and small fonts. The remedy is **hygiene** (blink, breaks, distance shifts) and **environment** (lighting, contrast, font size).
* **Hand/Wrist/Forearm**: Risk clusters include **repetition**, **force**, **awkward wrist angles** (extension/deviation), and **contact stress** at the carpal tunnel. Prevention relies on **neutral wrist**, hardware that fits, microbreaks, and load rotation.
* **Neck/Shoulders/Back**: Prolonged flexion (head forward), rounded shoulders, and static sitting weaken posterior chain and shorten hip flexors. Relief requires **alignment** and **movement frequency**, not just a “better chair.”
* **Cardio-metabolic**: Inactivity degrades insulin sensitivity and VO₂ max. **Non‑exercise activity** (standing, walking, stair use) matters as much as workouts.

### 3) Behavior Architecture Over Willpower

* The book argues for **habits and constraints** instead of motivation sprints. Use timers, checklists, and environmental nudges to make the healthy action **default** (e.g., screen break prompts, standing reminders, water at arm’s reach, easy fruit on desk).
* **Tiny commitments** (two‑minute warm‑up, five squats) seed larger, consistent behaviors.

### 4) Measurement Culture

* What you **measure** improves: sleep hours; daily steps; break adherence; pain score (0–10); typing time; and **unit tests for vision** (simple app‑based acuity checks).
* Iterate like software: ship a configuration, inspect logs, adjust.

### 5) Operating Constraints of the Job

* Deadlines and on‑call rotations won’t disappear. The antidote is to **amortize health across the day**: micro‑workouts, stretch “compilers,” and active meetings.
* The book emphasizes **pragmatism**: small, sticky routines beat heroic, short‑lived overhauls.

## Part II — Practice: Checklists, Setups, and Mini‑Routines

> The following checklists are formatted for copy‑pasting into a README, wiki, or personal playbook.

### A) Vision Safety (Computer Vision Syndrome)

**Goals**

* Maintain comfortable focus; reduce eye strain, dryness, and headaches; protect long‑term visual capacity.

**Workstation**

* Set monitor so the **top edge is at or slightly below eye level**; the center should be ~15–20° below horizontal gaze.
* Place screen **20–40 in (50–100 cm)** from your eyes; adjust font scaling until you never squint.
* Use **diffuse, bright lighting**; avoid glare and sharp reflections. Consider a matte screen or reposition lights.
* Turn on **dark mode** or high‑contrast themes if they reduce strain for you.

**Habits (“20‑20‑20”)**

* Every **20 minutes**, look at something **20 feet (6 m)** away for **20 seconds**.
* **Blink** deliberately during breaks; use lubricating drops if recommended by a clinician.
* Alternate tasks that use **different focal distances** (paper reading, whiteboard, window views).

**Quick Tests (“Unit‑tests for vision”)**

* Run a phone/desktop app to check **visual acuity** weekly. If you notice decline or asymmetry between eyes, schedule a professional exam.
* Track **time‑to‑comfort** when switching from close work to distance; if it climbs, increase breaks.

**Red Flags → clinician**

* Persistent headaches, diplopia (double vision), halos, very dry or painful eyes, or sudden changes in clarity.

---

### B) Wrist, Hand, and Forearm Safety

**Goals**

* Maintain neutral wrist angles; reduce tendon and median‑nerve irritation; avoid escalation toward CTS.

**Hardware & Position**

* Keyboard flat or with a slight negative tilt; shoulders relaxed; elbows **90–110°**; wrists **neutral** (no extension/deviation).
* Try split/ergonomic keyboards; consider **tenting** to reduce ulnar deviation.
* Choose a mouse that fits your hand (vertical, trackball, or standard) and keep it **close** with minimal reach.
* Use a **light touch**; avoid pounding keys; reduce pointer acceleration and increase pointer speed if it reduces gripping force.

**Habits**

* **Microbreaks**: every 20–30 minutes, ungrip your mouse/keyboard, open/close hands, shake out tension for **10–20 s**.
* Rotate repetitive tasks (e.g., batch renaming, code refactors) with less demanding activities.
* Consider **voice input** for bursts when wrists are irritated.

**Relief Drills (gentle, pain‑free)**

* **Tendon glides** (finger flexion/extension patterns).
* **Median‑nerve mobilization** (gentle extension with elbow straight; neck side‑bend away).
* **Forearm flexor/extensor stretches** (15–30 s; 2–3 reps).

> Stop any drill that produces numbness/tingling; seek evaluation.

**Red Flags → clinician**

* Numbness/tingling in thumb–index–middle fingers; night pain; weakness; symptoms that persist beyond a week despite rest.

---

### C) Neck, Shoulders, and Back

**Goals**

* Reduce forward‑head and rounded‑shoulder posture; restore thoracic extension; maintain hip mobility and posterior‑chain strength.

**Workstation**

* Chair: adjustable height so hips and knees are level (~90°), with **lumbar support**.
* Keyboard/mouse close to torso; avoid reaching.
* If possible, use a **sit‑stand desk** and vary position **every 30–60 minutes**.

**Mini‑Routines**

* **Chin tucks** (gently draw head backward; 5–10 reps).
* **Scapular retraction** (pinch shoulder blades; 5–10 reps; avoid shrugging).
* **Thoracic extension over chair back** (gentle, 5–8 reps).
* **Hip‑flexor stretch** (half‑kneel or standing lunge; 30 s each side).
* **Hamstring/calf stretch** (30 s each side).
* **Doorway pec stretch** (30 s each side).

**Red Flags → clinician**

* Radiating pain, numbness/weakness in limbs, persistent midline spinal pain, or symptoms after a fall/accident.

### D) Workstation Ergonomics — Quick Setup

1. **Screen**: distance 50–100 cm; top at/below eye level; center slightly below gaze; main monitor directly in front.
2. **Seat**: hips back in chair; lumbar support; feet flat (footrest if needed).
3. **Keyboard/Mouse**: close to body; elbows 90–110°; wrists neutral; shoulders relaxed.
4. **Lighting**: bright and diffuse; minimize glare; position lights perpendicular to screen.
5. **Accessories**: external keyboard/mouse for laptops; laptop on a stand; use headset for long calls.

---

### E) Break Architecture, Timers, and Sprints

* **Pomodoro‑style** cadence: **25–30 min focus** + **3–5 min movement**; after four cycles, take **15–20 min** active break.
* **Movement snacks** during breaks: 10 squats, 10 calf raises, 10 wall push‑ups, 10 band pull‑aparts, one lap around the office/home.
* **Standing meetings** to reduce sitting time and improve engagement.

---

### F) Conditioning: Programming Your Body

**Daily Minimums**

* **Steps**: target **7,000–10,000** (or add 2–3 short walks).
* **Strength** (2–3×/week): squats, hip hinges (deadlift pattern or bridges), push (push‑ups), pull (rows), carry (farmer carry).
* **Mobility** (most days): thoracic, hips, ankles, wrists.

**Session Sketch (20–30 min)**

* Warm‑up: cat‑cow, arm circles, leg swings (3–5 min).
* Strength circuit: 3–4 movements × 8–12 reps; 2–3 rounds.
* Finisher: brisk walk or cycle 5–10 min.

> Start light; build gradually; quality > quantity.

---

### G) Sleep, Stress, Hydration, and Nutrition

**Sleep (keystone)**

* Aim for **7–9 hours**; constant sleep/wake time; dark, cool room; reduce late caffeine and blue‑light exposure.
* Treat all‑nighters and pager duty as **exceptions**; “repay” with earlier bedtime and light days.

**Hydration**

* Keep water within arm’s reach; sip regularly; watch urine color (pale straw ideal).
* Adjust intake upward in hot rooms or long speaking days.

**Nutrition (pragmatic)**

* Center meals on **protein + vegetables + fiber**; keep **fruit and nuts** visible on desk; minimize ultra‑processed snacks.
* Time caffeine for focus blocks; avoid late‑day overload that sabotages sleep.

**Stress**

* Use **breath resets** (four‑second inhale, six‑second exhale × 6–10 cycles).
* Block calendars for **deep work**; batch alerts; create “quiet hours.”

---

### H) Team Practices That Scale Health

* **Shared norms**: commit to break prompts and walking 1:1s.
* **Meeting design**: 45/50‑minute meetings to leave 10 minutes to stand/walk before next.
* **Async first** to reduce Zoom‑marathon days.
* **Ops rotations**: spread on‑call load; create post‑incident recovery days.

---

## Part III — Protocols (Copy‑Ready)

### 1) Eye‑Care Protocol (Daily)

* 20‑20‑20 rule; blink on purpose during breaks.
* Monitor at 50–100 cm; top at/below eyes; high‑contrast fonts or dark mode.
* Hydrate; use artificial tears only if advised.
* Weekly quick acuity check; record headaches or dry‑eye episodes.

### 2) Wrist‑Care Protocol (Daily)

* Neutral wrist and light key touch; mouse close; reduce grip force.
* Microbreaks every 20–30 min (open/close hands; shake out tension).
* Gentle tendon glides and forearm stretches (pain‑free).
* If numbness or night pain → pause and seek evaluation.

### 3) Neck/Back Protocol (Daily)

* Every work hour: 5–10 **chin tucks** and **scapular retraction**.
* 2–3 mobility blocks/day: thoracic extension over chair; hip‑flexor + hamstring stretch.
* Alternate sitting/standing if you have a sit‑stand desk.

### 4) Focus Cadence

* 25–30 min deep work + 3–5 min movement; after 4 cycles, 15–20 min active break.
* Park the next task in a **ready state** before breaks to ease restart.

### 5) Minimal Conditioning (3×/week)

* 5‑min warm‑up → 20‑min circuit (squat/hinge/push/pull) → 5‑min walk.
* Track loads and RPE (effort 1–10) to progress gradually.

### 6) Emergency “Pain Protocol” (Immediate Triage)

* **Stop** the provoking task; record where pain started and what posture you had.
* **Reset** posture; switch to a non‑provoking task; micro‑movement every 5 min.
* If pain/tingling persists **>48–72 h** or worsens → clinical evaluation.

## Part IV — Implementation: Make It Stick

1. **Automate reminders** (menu bar timers, mobile widgets).
2. **Visible tools**: resistance band on chair; water bottle on desk.
3. **Public commitment**: team health stand‑up; share streaks.
4. **Version your setup**: keep a “CHANGELOG.md” of workstation tweaks and what worked.
5. **Review weekly**: wins, blockers, next tweaks.
