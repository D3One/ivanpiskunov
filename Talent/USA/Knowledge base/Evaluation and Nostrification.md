We'll explore the key differences between evaluation and nostrification, walk through the step-by-step evaluation process, introduce reputable credential assessment services, and provide detailed guidance on navigating the WES (World Education Services) evaluation system‚Äîone of the most widely accepted evaluation services in North America. With proper preparation and understanding of these processes, you can ensure your educational achievements receive the recognition they deserve in the American context.

## üìö Understanding the Key Concepts

### What is Credential Evaluation?

**Credential evaluation** (also called "—ç–≤–∞–ª—é–∞—Ü–∏—è") is a comprehensive process that assesses the **academic value** of your foreign education within the context of the American educational system. Rather than simply validating the authenticity of your documents, evaluation services determine how your international credentials compare to U.S. educational standards, including the **equivalent level** of education (e.g., whether your degree corresponds to a U.S. bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree) and sometimes your **grade point average (GPA)** on the American 4.0 scale .

This process involves specialized assessment organizations that analyze your diplomas, transcripts, and other academic documents to determine their U.S. equivalents. The evaluation doesn't automatically guarantee recognition but provides American institutions, employers, and immigration authorities with the necessary context to understand your educational background .

### What is Nostrification?

**Nostrification** refers to the **formal recognition** of foreign educational documents to grant them the same legal validity in another country as they hold in their country of origin. While the term "nostrification" is commonly used in many countries, in the United States, this process is more commonly referred to as "credential recognition" or "validation" .

Unlike some countries with centralized education ministries that handle recognition procedures, the U.S. employs a **decentralized approach** where credential evaluation is primarily conducted by private organizations specializing in international education assessment .

### Key Differences Between Evaluation and Nostrification

*Table: Comparison Between Credential Evaluation and Nostrification*

| **Aspect** | **Credential Evaluation** | **Nostrification** |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Determines U.S. equivalence of foreign education  | Formal recognition of foreign documents' validity  |
| **Main Outcome** | Report showing U.S. equivalent degree/credits  | Legal recognition of qualifications |
| **Common Use Cases** | Education continuation, employment, immigration  | Professional licensing, government positions |
| **Process Focus** | Academic equivalence and comparability  | Document authenticity and legal status |
| **Typical Requirements** | Diplomas, transcripts, translations  | Apostille, notarized copies, verification |

## üöÄ The Credential Evaluation Process

### Purpose and Importance of Evaluation

Credential evaluation serves several crucial functions for internationally educated professionals and students in the United States:

- **Educational Advancement**: American universities and colleges require credential evaluations to determine whether applicants meet admission requirements for advanced degree programs. The evaluation helps admissions committees understand your previous education and ensures you have the necessary academic background for their programs .

- **Employment Opportunities**: U.S. employers use evaluation reports to verify that your international education matches the educational requirements for specific positions. This is particularly important for regulated professions and positions that specify degree requirements .

- **Immigration Procedures**: Various U.S. immigration categories, including employment-based visas and certain permanent residency applications, require educational credential evaluations to establish that applicants meet the educational criteria for these pathways .

- **Professional Licensing**: For regulated professions such as engineering, healthcare, and education, state licensing boards often require specific types of credential evaluations to determine whether your international education meets their licensing requirements .

### Types of Credential Evaluations

## üèõÔ∏è Where to Get Your Credential Evaluated

### Recognized Evaluation Services

The United States lacks a centralized government agency for credential evaluation. Instead, this service is provided by private organizations that specialize in international educational systems. The most widely recognized evaluation services belong to two main associations:

- **NACES Members**: The National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES) is an association of private credential evaluation services committed to formulating and maintaining ethical standards in the field of foreign credential evaluation . Currently, there are approximately 19-20 member organizations in NACES .

- **AICE Members**: The Association of International Credential Evaluators (AICE) is another professional association that sets standards for credential evaluation services and includes multiple member organizations .

### Choosing an Evaluation Service

Selecting the right evaluation service requires careful consideration of your specific needs:

- **Check Requirements**: Always verify with the requesting organization (university, employer, immigration authority) whether they have specific preferences for evaluation services. Some institutions explicitly require evaluations from specific providers .

- **Compare Services**: Different evaluation companies may offer varying processing times, costs, and specific services. Research multiple options before making your decision .

- **Consider Specialization**: Some evaluation services have particular expertise with certain countries' educational systems or specific types of credentials .

- **Review Processing Times**: Standard processing typically takes several weeks, but many services offer expedited options for an additional fee .

### Popular Evaluation Services

- **World Education Services (WES)**: One of the most widely recognized evaluation services, particularly for academic and immigration purposes. WES is known for its comprehensive database of international educational systems .

- **Educational Credential Evaluators (ECE)**: Another well-respected service that offers various evaluation types for different purposes .

- **Other Providers**: Additional recognized services include Educational Records Evaluation Service (ERES) and members of both NACES and AICE associations .

## üìù The WES Evaluation Process: Step by Step

World Education Services (WES) is one of the most popular choices for credential evaluation in the United States and Canada. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to navigating the WES evaluation process:

### 1. Initial Application and Account Creation

Begin by creating an account on the WES website (wes.org) and completing the online application. During this process, you'll need to provide personal information exactly as it appears on your educational documents, select the type of evaluation you require, and provide details about your educational history. Upon completion, WES will assign you a unique **reference number** that must be included on all documents and correspondence .

### 2. Document Preparation and Submission

Document requirements have evolved in recent years, with WES now prioritizing **electronic verification** directly from educational institutions when possible. The current preferred process involves:

- **Contact Your Institution**: Request that your educational institution (university or college) prepare official academic documents in a sealed envelope or send them directly to WES electronically if they have an agreement with WES .

- **Required Documents**: Typically include diplomas and detailed academic transcripts showing all courses completed, grades received, and hours of study .

- **Translation Requirements**: If your documents aren't in English, you'll need certified translations. However, for many countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, WES may not require translations of documents issued in Russian .

### 3. Payment and Submission

WES evaluation fees vary depending on the type of evaluation and delivery options:

- **Course-by-Course Evaluation**: Approximately $170-217 depending on whether you select the WES Basic or WES ICAP service (which includes permanent record storage) .

- **Document-by-Document Evaluation**: Approximately $154-170 .

- **Additional Costs**: May include shipping fees, rush service fees, and fees for additional report copies .

### 4. Evaluation Timeline and Results

Once WES receives all required documents, the evaluation process typically takes:

- **Standard Processing**: 7-10 business days for complete applications 
- **Delayed Processing**: Additional time may be required if WES needs to verify information with your educational institution 

Upon completion, WES will send the evaluation report to you and, if requested, directly to designated recipients such as universities, employers, or immigration authorities .

## üí° Important Considerations and Tips

### Special Circumstances

- **Name Changes**: If your current name differs from what appears on your educational documents, you'll need to provide official documentation of the name change (such as a marriage certificate or legal name change document) .

- **Multiple Degrees**: When evaluating multiple degrees, you can typically include them in a single application, though the pricing structure may vary depending on the evaluation service .

- **Institutional Changes**: If your educational institution has changed names or status since you attended, include documentation of these changes to facilitate the verification process .

### Common Challenges and Solutions

- **Uncooperative Institutions**: If your educational institution is unable or unwilling to send documents directly to WES, contact WES support for alternative submission methods. In some cases, they may accept documents with apostilles as was previously required .

- **Non-Accredited Institutions**: WES and other recognized evaluation services typically cannot evaluate credentials from institutions without proper government accreditation .

- **Missing Documents**: Incomplete applications will delay the evaluation process. Ensure you provide all required documents in the specified format to avoid processing delays .

## üîó Official Resources and Institutions

When navigating the credential evaluation process, it's essential to consult authoritative sources for the most current requirements and procedures:

- **U.S. Department of State** (state.gov): Provides information on document authentication and international education recognition .

- **National Association of Credential Evaluation Services (NACES)** (naces.org): Complete list of member organizations and their services .
