## 🔍 Introduction: Understanding Diploma Recognition in America

For immigrants, international students, and professionals pursuing opportunities in the United States, navigating the complex landscape of **foreign educational credential recognition** represents a critical step toward achieving their American dreams. The process of having your international education recognized in the U.S. can feel daunting, with terminology that often causes confusion and procedures that vary depending on your goals. Whether you seek to continue your education, practice your profession, or meet immigration requirements, understanding the distinction between **credential evaluation** (commonly known as "эвалюация" in Russian) and **diploma recognition** ("нострификация") is fundamental to developing a successful strategy.

This comprehensive guide will demystify both processes, providing clear, actionable information about how to have your international education properly recognized in the United States. We'll explore the key differences between evaluation and nostrification, walk through the step-by-step evaluation process, introduce reputable credential assessment services, and provide detailed guidance on navigating the WES (World Education Services) evaluation system—one of the most widely accepted evaluation services in North America. With proper preparation and understanding of these processes, you can ensure your educational achievements receive the recognition they deserve in the American context.

## 📚 Understanding the Key Concepts

### What is Credential Evaluation?

**Credential evaluation** (also called "эвалюация") is a comprehensive process that assesses the **academic value** of your foreign education within the context of the American educational system. Rather than simply validating the authenticity of your documents, evaluation services determine how your international credentials compare to U.S. educational standards, including the **equivalent level** of education (e.g., whether your degree corresponds to a U.S. bachelor's, master's, or doctoral degree) and sometimes your **grade point average (GPA)** on the American 4.0 scale .

This process involves specialized assessment organizations that analyze your diplomas, transcripts, and other academic documents to determine their U.S. equivalents. The evaluation doesn't automatically guarantee recognition but provides American institutions, employers, and immigration authorities with the necessary context to understand your educational background .

### What is Nostrification?

**Nostrification** refers to the **formal recognition** of foreign educational documents to grant them the same legal validity in another country as they hold in their country of origin. While the term "nostrification" is commonly used in many countries, in the United States, this process is more commonly referred to as "credential recognition" or "validation" .

Unlike some countries with centralized education ministries that handle recognition procedures, the U.S. employs a **decentralized approach** where credential evaluation is primarily conducted by private organizations specializing in international education assessment .

### Key Differences Between Evaluation and Nostrification

| **Aspect** | **Credential Evaluation** | **Nostrification** |
|------------|---------------------------|---------------------|
| **Primary Purpose** | Determines U.S. equivalence of foreign education  | Formal recognition of foreign documents' validity  |
| **Main Outcome** | Report showing U.S. equivalent degree/credits  | Legal recognition of qualifications |

| **Process Focus** | Academic equivalence and comparability  | Document authenticity and legal status |
| **Typical Requirements** | Diplomas, transcripts, translations  | Apostille, notarized copies, verification |

## 🚀 The Credential Evaluation Process

### Purpose and Importance of Evaluation

Credential evaluation serves several crucial functions for internationally educated professionals and students in the United States:

## 📝 The WES Evaluation Process: Step by Step

World Education Services (WES) is one of the most popular choices for credential evaluation in the United States and Canada. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide to navigating the WES evaluation process:

### 1. Initial Application and Account Creation

Begin by creating an account on the WES website (wes.org) and completing the online application. During this process, you'll need to provide personal information exactly as it appears on your educational documents, select the type of evaluation you require, and provide details about your educational history. Upon completion, WES will assign you a unique **reference number** that must be included on all documents and correspondence .

### 2. Document Preparation and Submission

Document requirements have evolved in recent years, with WES now prioritizing **electronic verification** directly from educational institutions when possible. The current preferred process involves:

- **Contact Your Institution**: Request that your educational institution (university or college) prepare official academic documents in a sealed envelope or send them directly to WES electronically if they have an agreement with WES .

- **Required Documents**: Typically include diplomas and detailed academic transcripts showing all courses completed, grades received, and hours of study .

- **Translation Requirements**: If your documents aren't in English, you'll need certified translations. However, for many countries including Russia, Kazakhstan, and Belarus, WES may not require translations of documents issued in Russian .

### 3. Payment and Submission

WES evaluation fees vary depending on the type of evaluation and delivery options:

- **Course-by-Course Evaluation**: Approximately $170-217 depending on whether you select the WES Basic or WES ICAP service (which includes permanent record storage) .

- **Document-by-Document Evaluation**: Approximately $154-170 .

- **Additional Costs**: May include shipping fees, rush service fees, and fees for additional report copies .

### 4. Evaluation Timeline and Results

Once WES receives all required documents, the evaluation process typically takes:

- **Standard Processing**: 7-10 business days for complete applications 
- **Delayed Processing**: Additional time may be required if WES needs to verify information with your educational institution 

Upon completion, WES will send the evaluation report to you and, if requested, directly to designated recipients such as universities, employers, or immigration authorities .

## 💡 Important Considerations and Tips

### Special Circumstances

- **Name Changes**: If your current name differs from what appears on your educational documents, you'll need to provide official documentation of the name change (such as a marriage certificate or legal name change document) .

- **Multiple Degrees**: When evaluating multiple degrees, you can typically include them in a single application, though the pricing structure may vary depending on the evaluation service .

- **Institutional Changes**: If your educational institution has changed names or status since you attended, include documentation of these changes to facilitate the verification process .

### Common Challenges and Solutions

- **Uncooperative Institutions**: If your educational institution is unable or unwilling to send documents directly to WES, contact WES support for alternative submission methods. In some cases, they may accept documents with apostilles as was previously required .

- **Non-Accredited Institutions**: WES and other recognized evaluation services typically cannot evaluate credentials from institutions without proper government accreditation .

- **Missing Documents**: Incomplete applications will delay the evaluation process. Ensure you provide all required documents in the specified format to avoid processing delays .
