</details></div>

<p>Structure: author credentials → basis of knowledge → concrete achievements → field impact → independent corroboration. Avoid generic praise.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='6'>Self‑Help: Drafting &amp; Assembly</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Translations &amp; Certifications</summary>
<p>Translate every non‑English exhibit in full; attach a translator’s certification of competence and accuracy. Maintain consistent formatting; official extracts may be acceptable where complete.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>

</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>

</details></div>
<h2 id='7'>Interview — Deep Dive</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Before the Interview</summary>
<p>Align DS‑260/DS‑160 answers with your petition; bring a one‑page case summary and exhibit index. Originals + copies for civil docs; sort by applicant. Plan logistics (photos, courier, security rules).</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Question Bank (Examples)</summary>
<p>Background &amp; role: ‘What do you do? Who is the U.S. employer/client? Why you?’.</p>
<p>Evidence: ‘Tell me about this award/publication/judging — how competitive was it?’.</p>
<p>U.S. plans: ‘Where will you work? What outcomes do you expect in year one?’.</p>
<p>Compliance: past visas, overstays, arrests, export‑control red flags — answer succinctly and truthfully.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Answering Style</summary>
<p>Be concise, consistent, and use plain English. Anchor each major achievement with one numeric proof (citations, users, revenue, ratings, standards, adoption).</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='8'>Administrative Processing — 221(g)/SAO</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>What 221(g) Means</summary>
<p>A temporary refusal pending checks or documents; the case remains active. Colored sheets are local cues; follow the written checklist on your 221(g) notice.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Typical Triggers &amp; Remedies</summary>
<p>Triggers: TAL‑related fields, inconsistent histories, missing police certificates, unclear employment/endeavor, security hits. Remedies: submit exactly what’s requested, maintain a tracker, avoid duplicate emails, escalate politely if deadlines lapse.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>CEAC Statuses in AP</summary>
<p>Common labels: ‘Refused’ (standard wording during AP), ‘Administrative Processing’, ‘Ready’, and ‘Issued’. Focus on requested actions rather than labels.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>SAO/MANTIS (Export‑Controlled Tech)</summary>
<p>If your work overlaps sensitive tech, expect interagency checks. Prepare a clean technical CV, publications, project summaries, funding sources, and plain‑language statements of non‑restricted, civilian use.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='9'>Visa Bulletin — How to Read &amp; Use</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Key Concepts</summary>
<p>Priority Date (PD): PERM filing date for PERM cases; I‑140 receipt date for NIW/EB‑1. Chargeability is usually your country of birth. Two charts: Final Action Dates (approvals/visas) and Dates for Filing (AOS filing when permitted).</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Movement &amp; Retrogression</summary>
<p>If your PD is later than the listed date, you wait until movement catches up; dates can retrogress (move backward). Track month‑to‑month trends for planning.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Strategy — Concurrent Filing</summary>
<p>When USCIS permits the ‘Dates for Filing’ chart and your PD is current, consider filing I‑485 (and I‑765/I‑131) with or after I‑140 to lock in benefits while the petition is pending.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='10'>CEAC &amp; NVC — Quick Reference</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>NVC Stage</summary>
<p>Expect case creation email with Case Number and Invoice ID. Pay fees, complete DS‑260, upload civil documents. ‘Documentarily Qualified’ = queued for interview scheduling.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Post Stage</summary>
<p>CEAC statuses: ‘Ready’ (post can interview), ‘Refused’ (includes AP), ‘Administrative Processing’ (under review), ‘Issued’ (visa printed). Follow post‑specific passport pickup instructions.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='11'>DS‑260 vs. DS‑160</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Which Form &amp; When</summary>
<p>DS‑260 = immigrant visas (EB‑1/EB‑2 NIW via consular path). DS‑160 = nonimmigrant visas (e.g., O‑1).</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Common Pitfalls</summary>
<p>Inconsistent dates; gaps in address/work history; missing social media identifiers; unreported prior denials or arrests; inconsistent transliteration. Use exact legal names and truthful, non‑speculative answers.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='12'>NVC Document Pack</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Suggested Structure</summary>
<p>By applicant (principal/spouse/child): passports; birth/marriage/divorce certificates + translations; police certificates; court records if any; financial/support docs per category; photos; post‑specific items; fee receipts.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='13'>Medical (I‑693) &amp; I‑94</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Medicals — Consular vs. AOS</summary>
<p>Consular: panel physicians only; follow sealed‑envelope rules. AOS: USCIS‑designated civil surgeons. Bring prior vaccination records to avoid duplication.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>I‑94 — What to Check</summary>
<p>After each entry, verify class of admission and admit‑until date. Save PDFs/screenshots; correct errors via CBP Deferred Inspection or counsel.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='14'>After Landing — First 30–60 Days</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Checklist</summary>
<p>SSN (if not auto‑issued), state ID/driver’s license, bank accounts, health insurance, employer onboarding, address registration where applicable. Keep copies of visa packet and I‑551 stamp (if issued).</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='15'>Expedites — USCIS, NVC, Consulates</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>When &amp; How</summary>
<p>Consider emergencies, urgent U.S. business/government interests, or clear agency error. Tailor evidence to the adjudicator (USCIS service request, NVC inquiry, consular emergency appointment policy).</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='16'>TAL — Export‑Control Awareness</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Sensitive Areas (Examples)</summary>
<p>Advanced materials, aerospace, AI/ML with dual‑use, encryption, high‑energy physics, biotech with export‑control concerns. Provide plain‑English summaries and end‑use statements to mitigate.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='17'>Templates &amp; Checklists</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Interview‑Day Checklist</summary>
<p>Passport; photos; appointment letter; originals + copies (civil docs &amp; translations, police certificates); medical results; I‑140/I‑129 approval; exhibit summary; payment receipts; courier info.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>221(g) Response Cover Letter (Skeleton)</summary>
<p>Header (case number, applicant, post, date) → bullet requested items and attach labeled exhibits → close with concise status update and contact details.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Visa Bulletin Worksheet</summary>
<p>Track category, chargeability, PD, current Final Action/Date for Filing, and next review date; note monthly movement and action items.</p>
</details></div>
