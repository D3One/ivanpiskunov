<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Community &amp; Tools</summary>
<p>The project is community‑driven and pairs how‑to articles with real‑world experience. It also references a free AI helper and active Telegram groups that share attorney feedback, interview experiences, and document checklists.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='2'>O‑1 Visa</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>O‑1: What It Is</summary>
<p>The O‑1 is a temporary U.S. employment classification for individuals with extraordinary ability in sciences, business, education, athletics (O‑1A), or arts, motion picture/television (O‑1B). You must show sustained acclaim through regulatory criteria. A U.S. employer or a qualified agent files Form I‑129.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Sponsor Models (Employer vs. Agent)</summary>
<p>Employer model: your U.S. company files Form I‑129 listing your role, duties, and dates.</p>
<p>Agent model: allowed where engagements involve multiple end‑clients or venues. Include proof of agency authority, a master contract, end‑client letters, and a dated itinerary covering the petition period.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Eligibility &amp; Criteria (O‑1A)</summary>
<p>One‑time major award (internationally recognized) OR at least three of these: nationally/internationally recognized prizes; membership with achievement‑based selection; published material about you; judging the work of others; original contributions of major significance; scholarly articles; leading/critical role; high remuneration; commercial success (arts); exhibitions/showcases (arts).</p>
<p>Final merits: demonstrate sustained acclaim and that you will continue working in the area of extraordinary ability.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Eligibility &amp; Criteria (O‑1B Arts / Film &amp; TV)</summary>
<p>Show distinction in the arts or extraordinary achievement in motion picture/TV via prominent productions, critical reviews, audience/box office metrics, and leading/critical roles.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Evidence Playbook (O‑1)</summary>
<p>Awards: prove selectivity and reputation (organizer profile, press, jury).</p>
<p>Media about you: use independent outlets; include full‑text copies and basic circulation/traffic stats for context.</p>
<p>Judging: invitations, programs/journal assignments, evidence of completed reviews or scores.</p>
<p>Original contributions: document adoption, measurable impact, standards involvement, or third‑party implementation.</p>
<p>High remuneration: compare to market percentiles for your specialty and location; include contracts and tax forms.</p>
<p>Leading/critical role: org charts, KPIs, letters from executives tying outcomes to your role; add external corroboration.</p>
<p>Scholarly articles: copies, indexing/peer‑review info, citations/altmetrics if applicable.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>O‑1 Process — Step by Step</summary>
<p>1) Define the role and collect contracts/LOIs; 2) Map evidence to criteria; 3) Draft letters (recommendations, end‑client support); 4) Obtain advisory opinions where required; 5) Assemble I‑129 with exhibits; 6) File with correct fee(s), then consular visa or start work if changing status in the U.S.</p>
<p>Premium Processing accelerates USCIS adjudication but not consular appointment queues.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Document Checklist (O‑1)</summary>
<p>• Form I‑129 + O Supplement; G‑28 if represented; filing fee(s)/I‑907 if using Premium Processing.</p>

<p>• Advisory opinion(s) if applicable; recommendation letters; evidence exhibits; translations with translator’s certification.</p>
<p>• Passport biographic page; current status evidence if filing inside the U.S.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>O‑1 RFE/NOID Patterns &amp; Fixes</summary>
<p>Frequent triggers: generic letters; low‑selectivity awards/memberships; gaps in agent itineraries; weak linkage from contributions to industry‑wide impact.</p>
<p>Fixes: add independent corroboration, measurable outcomes, and corrected itinerary/contract documentation.</p>
</details></div>
<h2 id='3'>EB‑1 (A/B/C)</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>EB‑1 in Plain English</summary>
<p>EB‑1 is an immigrant category leading to a green card. EB‑1A is for individuals of extraordinary ability (self‑petition allowed); EB‑1B is for outstanding professors/researchers with a qualifying offer; EB‑1C is for multinational managers/executives transferring to a U.S. affiliate.</p>
</details></div>

<p>Meet at least three of ten regulatory criteria (or a one‑time major achievement) and pass the final merits analysis showing sustained acclaim among the small percentage at the top of the field.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>EB‑1B — Outstanding Professor/Researcher</summary>
<p>Requires a qualifying U.S. employer, at least three years of teaching/research, and at least two of six evidentiary categories (major prizes, selective memberships, published material about the work, judging, original research, authorship of scholarly books/articles).</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>EB‑1C — Multinational Manager/Executive</summary>

</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>

<p>Prioritize independent validation: awards with recognized prestige, peer‑review roles, third‑party adoption/usage, standards involvement, and measurable outcomes (citations, revenue, users, patents/licensing).</p>
<p>Salary comparisons: use authoritative surveys and apples‑to‑apples comparators by role, seniority, and geography.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>Filing Paths &amp; Timing</summary>
<p>Adjustment of Status (I‑485) inside the U.S. or Consular Processing outside. If the Visa Bulletin is current for your category and chargeability area, consider concurrent I‑140/I‑485 filing.</p>
</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>AOS (I‑485) — What to Expect</summary>
<p>AOS changes status inside the U.S. to permanent resident after an underlying petition approval and visa availability. Typical add‑ons: I‑765 (work authorization) and I‑131 (Advance Parole). Follow current USCIS forms/fees and the Visa Bulletin for timing.</p>

<h2 id='4'>EB‑2 NIW</h2>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>NIW in Plain English</summary>
<p>EB‑2 NIW allows self‑petitioning without a job offer or PERM if your proposed endeavor has substantial merit and national importance, you are well positioned to advance it, and on balance it benefits the U.S. to waive the job offer.</p>

</details></div>
<div class='details'><details>
<summary>NIW FAQ &amp; RFE Patterns</summary>
<p>Avoid generic projects, unclear U.S. nexus, and soft, non‑independent letters. Remedy with quantified pilots/LOIs, specific U.S. stakeholders, and milestone‑based execution plans.</p>

<div class='details'><details>

<p>For EB‑1A, show how your future U.S. work continues your extraordinary track record (projects, employers, clients). Include LOIs or market validation where possible.</p>
</details></div>
