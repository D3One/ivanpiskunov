# Understanding the Kazarian Precedent in EB-1 Adjudications

U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) frequently employs a two-part framework, established by the Ninth Circuit in *Kazarian v. USCIS*, to evaluate EB-1 "Extraordinary Ability" petitions . The first part is a procedural check, requiring a petitioner to objectively satisfy at least three of the ten regulatory criteria. The second part, often called the "final merits determination," is more holistic and subjective. It requires the adjudicator to assess whether the combined evidence, in its totality, demonstrates a level of expertise and recognition that places the beneficiary among the small percentage at the very top of their field .

**The Weight of Each Criterion**

Merely meeting the minimum of three criteria does not guarantee approval. USCIS evaluates the quality and significance of the evidence supporting each criterion . A lesser-known award will not carry the same weight as a Nobel Prize. Similarly, membership in a less prestigious association may not be as significant as membership in a world-renowned organization. The final merits analysis looks beyond the mere presence of evidence to its persuasive power in proving sustained national or international acclaim .

**Navigating the Kazarian Framework**

A key strategy is to provide substantial corroborating evidence that not only meets but exceeds the requirements for each criterion. This can include detailed letters of recommendation from independent experts, comprehensive documentation of achievements, and evidence of a high salary or other significantly high remuneration compared to peers in the field .

Another critical approach is to prepare a persuasive narrative that weaves all the evidence into a cohesive story for the "final merits determination." This narrative should demonstrate sustained national or international acclaim and show that the applicant's contributions are of "major significance" to their field. By understanding the nuances of Kazarian, we aim to maximize your chances of a successful outcome in the EB-1 category by preparing a thorough and well-documented petition.

### üîç Practical Strategies for a Successful Petition

Building a strong EB-1A petition requires strategic planning beyond simply checking boxes. The two-step *Kazarian* analysis means that your evidence must pass both the initial eligibility screening and the final, comprehensive assessment of your career stature . To succeed in the final merits determination, you must contextualize your achievements.

A highly effective method is to secure detailed letters of recommendation from well-respected, independent experts in your field. These letters should do more than state you are qualified; they must specifically explain the importance and impact of your original contributions, validate the significance of your awards, and affirm your national or international reputation . These expert testimonials can also address potential shortcomings or provide clarity on complex achievements, thereby strengthening your overall case. This is particularly valuable if you receive a Request for Evidence (RFE) from USCIS .

Furthermore, when documenting your achievements, prioritize quality and impact over quantity. For instance, a single, highly influential patent or a scholarly article with a significant number of citations in independent research can be far more compelling than a larger number of minor accomplishments. The goal is to present a portfolio of evidence that, when viewed as a whole, leaves no doubt that you have risen to the very top of your field of endeavor .

### üìÑ Official Guidance and Evolving Standards

Staying informed on official policy is crucial, as USCIS guidance continues to evolve. The USCIS Policy Manual is the primary source for adjudication standards, and recent updates have provided helpful clarifications for EB-1A applicants .

In a significant update, USCIS clarified that it may consider the **receipt of a team award** as satisfying the criterion for "lesser nationally or internationally recognized prizes or awards for excellence" . This is critical for professionals in collaborative fields like scientific research or software engineering, whose major accomplishments are often part of a team effort.

Additionally, USCIS has clarified that **past memberships** in associations requiring outstanding achievements will be given equal consideration, even if you are no longer an active member . This acknowledges that career paths may involve transitioning between organizations while the prestige of earlier memberships remains relevant. These updates, detailed in the Policy Manual, demonstrate a trend toward a more practical and nuanced evaluation of evidence, allowing petitioners to present a more complete picture of their careers .
