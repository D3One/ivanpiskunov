# Immigration Glossary for EB-1A / O-1 / EB-2 NIW (U.S.-centric)

*This curated glossary cleans up common misconceptions, trims unnecessary explanations, and adds practitioner-grade terms and acronyms you’ll actually see in filings, notices, and case strategy. I kept it tight, U.S.-style, and focused on what matters for extraordinary ability and related employment-based paths.* *Items marked in **bold** are the ones that trip people up most often.*

---

## Agencies & acronyms you’ll meet

* **USCIS** — U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (DHS component that adjudicates petitions like I-140, I-485).
* **DOS** — U.S. Department of State (manages consular processing and the monthly Visa Bulletin).
* **NVC** — National Visa Center (DOS unit that pre-processes immigrant visa cases for consular interviews).
* **CBP** — U.S. Customs and Border Protection (admissions, I-94 records).
* **DOL** — U.S. Department of Labor (PERM labor certification for some EB-2/EB-3 cases; not required for EB-1A/NIW).
* **AAO** — Administrative Appeals Office (USCIS appellate body for many benefits decisions).

---

## A–Z: core terms, clear definitions

### **Adjustment of Status (AOS)**

Filing **Form I-485** inside the U.S. to become an LPR (green card holder). **AOS does not automatically grant work/travel**—you must file **I-765** for an EAD and **I-131** for advance parole (often filed together with I-485). Leaving the U.S. while I-485 is pending without advance parole usually **abandons** the application. ([USCIS][1])

*Tip: If your category is current and eligible, “**concurrent filing**” lets you file I-140 + I-485 (with I-765/I-131) together.* ([USCIS][2])

---

### Administrative Processing / **221(g)**

A temporary **visa refusal** at a U.S. consulate when the officer needs more info or security checks. CEAC may show status as **“Refused”** during processing; that can be overcome if you later qualify or supply requested evidence. ([Travel.state][3])

---

### **Advance Parole (AP)**

Travel authorization for certain applicants with a pending I-485, requested on **Form I-131**. Don’t travel without it unless you’re in a category that’s travel-authorized independently. ([USCIS][4])

---

### A-Number (Alien Registration Number)

A unique identifier (usually starts with “A”) assigned by DHS.

---

### **CFR / INA**

* **CFR** — Code of Federal Regulations (binding regulations; EB-1A criteria live at **8 CFR 204.5(h)**).
* **INA** — Immigration and Nationality Act (the statute). ([eCFR][5])

---

### **Chargeability / Cross-Chargeability**

“Chargeability” ties your visa line to a **country of birth**, not citizenship. **Cross-chargeability** can let you use your **spouse’s** or, in some cases, **parent’s** country when it reduces wait times. Strategy staple in backlogged categories. ([Foreign Affairs Manual][6])

---

### **Consular Processing (CP)**

Finishing the immigrant visa abroad via DOS and the **NVC** (then interview at a U.S. embassy/consulate). Alternative to AOS.

---

### **CSPA (Child Status Protection Act)**

Helps certain derivatives avoid “aging out” on turning 21 by adjusting the “CSPA age” (actual age **minus** time the petition was pending), keyed to when a **visa becomes available**. USCIS recently clarified “visa availability” timing for calculations—check current policy. ([USCIS][7])

---

### **Dates for Filing (DFF)** vs **Final Action Dates (FAD)**

Visa Bulletin has two charts. **FAD** governs approvals/visa issuance; **DFF** is an earlier filing trigger for some months. For AOS, USCIS announces monthly which chart you must use. **A visa is “available” when your PD is earlier than the chart’s cut-off for your category/chargeability.** ([USCIS][8])

---

### **Derivative Beneficiary**

Spouse or unmarried child (under 21 for immigrant purposes, subject to **CSPA**) of the principal beneficiary.

---

### **EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability)**

Self-petitionable classification under **8 CFR 204.5(h)** for those at the **very top** of their field, shown through a **one-time major award** or meeting **at least 3 of 10 criteria**, followed by a **final merits** determination of sustained acclaim. **Comparable evidence** may be used when criteria don’t neatly fit the field (e.g., founders, some STEM innovators). ([eCFR][5])

---

### **EAD (Employment Authorization Document)**

Work card (**I-765**) used while AOS is pending or when otherwise eligible. LPRs do **not** need EADs. ([USCIS][9])

---

### **FOIA (Freedom of Information Act)**

Tool to request records from DHS/CBP/USCIS (e.g., missing I-94 history, prior filings). ([U.S. Customs and Border Protection][10])

---

### **I-94**

Record of admission (class and expiration). Retrieve, print, or fix issues via CBP. ([U.S. Customs and Border Protection][11])

---

### **I-131** / **I-765** (see **Advance Parole** / **EAD**)

Travel and work filings commonly paired with I-485. ([USCIS][4])

---

### **I-140**

Immigrant petition for employment-based categories (EB-1/EB-2/EB-3). Governs your **priority date** in most cases. ([eCFR][12])

---

### **I-290B (AAO Appeal or Motion)**

Form to appeal to the **AAO** or to file a **Motion to Reopen/Reconsider** with USCIS after a denial/revocation. **Deadlines are short**—check the decision notice. ([USCIS][13])

---

### **I-485J (Supplement J)**

Confirmation of a bona fide job offer or **AC21 portability** for certain EB cases. (Not typically required for self-petitioned **EB-1A** with no job offer.)

---

### **I-693 (Medical Exam)**

USCIS civil surgeon completes/returns the sealed medical packet for USCIS. **Do not break the seal**; submit the **latest** valid edition as instructed. ([USCIS][14])

---

### **I-797 (Notice of Action) — know your letters**

* **I-797**: Generic receipt/approval.
* **I-797A**: Approval **with** new **I-94** (typically for in-U.S. extension/change of status).
* **I-797B**: Petition approval **without** I-94 (e.g., consular notification).
* **I-797C**: Receipt, rejection, transfer, biometrics/interview notices, etc.
* **I-797E**: **RFE** (Request for Evidence).
* **I-797F**: Transportation letter. ([USCIS][15])

---

### **NOID / NOIR**

* **NOID** — **Notice of Intent to Deny**: USCIS plans to deny unless you rebut.
* **NOIR** — **Notice of Intent to Revoke**: USCIS intends to revoke a prior **approval**; you can respond. ([USCIS][16])

---

### **PERM / ETA-9089**

DOL labor certification for many EB-2/EB-3 cases. **Not required** for EB-1A or EB-2 **NIW**.

---

### **Premium Processing (PP)**

Expedited adjudication via **I-907** and an extra fee. **Timing is by business days**, not calendar, and **varies by form/classification** (e.g., **15 business days** for most classifications like EB-1A; **45 business days** for **EB-1C** and **EB-2 NIW** I-140s). USCIS can approve, deny, or issue an RFE within the timeframe. ([USCIS][17])

*Tip: PP speeds the I-140 decision only; it doesn’t speed I-485.*

---

### **Priority Date (PD)**

Your place in the immigrant visa line. For I-140 cases, the PD is generally the **I-140 filing** date (or PERM filing date where applicable). You proceed when your PD is **earlier** than the cutoff on the applicable Visa Bulletin chart and USCIS says which chart to use for AOS that month. ([USCIS][18])

---

### **RFEs / RFIEs**

* **RFE** — Request for Evidence when USCIS needs more to decide.
* **RFIE** — Request for **Initial** Evidence (often early in I-485 adjudications). USCIS can deny without an RFE/NOID in certain situations, but generally uses these tools to develop the record. ([USCIS][19])

---

### **STEM**

Science, Technology, Engineering, Math. For F-1 students, DHS maintains the **STEM Designated Degree Program List** that governs STEM OPT extensions. (Not an immigrant classification by itself, but relevant to evidence narratives and background for EB-1/NIW.) ([ICE][20])

---

### **USCIS Policy Manual**

USCIS’s living handbook. Always check the latest chapters on **EB-1A** (final merits, comparable evidence) and **NIW** (advanced degree/exceptional ability + national-interest framework). ([USCIS][21])

---

## Quick myth-busting (so you don’t step on rakes)

* **“AOS gives me work authorization automatically.”** — **False.** File **I-765** (and **I-131** if you need travel). ([USCIS][9])
* **“Premium Processing is 15 calendar days for everyone.”** — **Nope.** It’s **business days**, and NIW/EB-1C I-140s run on **45** business days. ([USCIS][17])
* **“CEAC says ‘Refused,’ so my visa is dead.”** — Not necessarily. **221(g) refusals** can be resolved; the “Refused” label often reflects **administrative processing**. ([Travel.state][22])

*Pro tip:* **Cross-chargeability** can be a lifesaver for backlogged categories—plan it early. ([Foreign Affairs Manual][6])
