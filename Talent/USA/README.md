## EB-1A (Extraordinary Ability)

### Quick-Start Checklist (EB-1A)
- [ ] Write a **thesis sentence**: how your record proves **sustained national/international acclaim** and places you among the **small percentage at the top** of your field.  
- [ ] Choose your **strongest 4–5 criteria** and gather **objective validators** (adoption, citations, revenue, press, standards, judging).  
- [ ] Draft a **cover letter** with a 1-page roadmap; build **criterion chapters** that tie facts → exhibits → regulation.  
- [ ] Add a **Final Merits** section that synthesizes *why your whole record* satisfies “top of the field” + “sustained acclaim.”  
- [ ] Prepare **Form I-140** (+ **I-907** if using Premium Processing); confirm **current fees** via USCIS tools.  
- [ ] If your **priority date** is current and you’re eligible, consider **concurrent filing** of **I-485 + I-765 + I-131** (AOS).  
- [ ] If consular processing, review **NVC/CEAC** civil-document and scanning standards early.

### EB-1A Evidence Map (1-Page)
**Thesis (front-page abstract)**  
> *[Name]* has achieved **sustained national/international acclaim** through *[core contributions]* adopted by *[industry/academia/arts]* at scale, recognized by *[press/awards/standards]*, and will continue this work in the U.S.

**Criterion Buckets (pick 4–5 to make undeniable)**  
- **Original contributions of major significance** → adoption, standards, revenue, licensing.  
- **Judging** → peer review, juries (selectivity + materiality).  
- **Leading/critical role** → outcomes tied to your leadership at **distinguished** orgs (independent markers).  
- **Published material about you** → independent press/professional coverage with outlet authority.  
- **Awards** → national/international scope + competitiveness.  
- **High remuneration** → top-end pay vs surveys (normalize geo/role).  
- **Scholarly authorship** → peer review + field-normalized impact.  
- **Exhibitions/showcases** (arts) → tier, curator prestige, audience.  
- **Commercial success** (performing arts) → box office, charts, streams.  
- **Selective memberships** → bylaws proving merit-based admission.

**Final Merits Synthesis**  
Connect the **quality** and **significance** of your record to “**small percentage at the very top**” + “**sustained**” acclaim using third-party indicators.

### What EB-1A Is
A first-preference immigrant category for individuals with **extraordinary ability** in the sciences, arts, education, business, or athletics. You can **self-petition** (no job offer required) so long as you’ll continue working in your field in the U.S.

### Eligibility Framework (Two-Step Analysis)
1) **Regulatory check** — either a **one-time major award** or **≥3 of 10** listed criteria.  
2) **Final Merits** — holistic weighing of **quality and impact** to decide if you’re among the **small percentage at the top** with **sustained** acclaim.

### The Ten Regulatory Criteria (with practical evidence)
1) **Awards (lesser nationally/internationally recognized)** → scope, competitiveness, jury caliber.  
2) **Selective memberships** → bylaws showing merit-based selection by experts.  
3) **Published material about you** → independent authorship; outlet authority/metrics.  
4) **Judging** → invitations, volume, venue tier; **selectivity + scale**.  
5) **Original contributions of major significance** → adoption, citations, revenue, licensing, standards.  
6) **Scholarly authorship** → peer-reviewed venues; field-normalized impact.  
7) **Leading/critical role for distinguished orgs** → why org is “distinguished,” how your role was pivotal (KPIs).  
8) **High remuneration** → surveys, offers; base vs. total comp clarity.  
9) **Exhibitions/showcases** (arts) → venue tier, curator prestige, audience size.  
10) **Commercial success** (performing arts) → charts, certifications, box office.

### Comparable Evidence (EB-1A)
Use **comparable evidence** when a listed criterion doesn’t fit your occupation (e.g., certain STEM founders). Explain *why* the criterion is a poor fit and *why* your substitute proof is **equally probative** of acclaim/top-tier status.

### How to Package (EB-1A)
- **Cover Letter (outline)**  
  I. 1-page roadmap (thesis + map of criteria)  
  II. Criterion chapters (Facts → Exhibits → Regulation)  
  III. **Final Merits** synthesis (2–3 pages)  
- **Exhibits**: tabbed, paginated, consistent names (`C3_Judging_IEEE_2024.pdf`).  
- **Translations**: certificate + source scans.  
- **Index**: one-line parentheticals (“what this proves”).

### Filing Flow (EB-1A)
1) File **I-140** (Extraordinary Ability).  
2) If eligible and **visa numbers available**, consider **concurrent filing** of **I-485 + I-765 + I-131**.  
3) If abroad, proceed via **NVC/CEAC** after approval and visa availability.  
4) Track the **Visa Bulletin** and USCIS’s **AOS chart** page monthly.

### Premium Processing (EB-1A)
- Upgrade via **I-907**; clocks are in **business days**. Affects **I-140 only** (not I-485/EAD/AP).

### RFEs / NOIDs (EB-1A)
- Treat as a structured second chance; mirror headings, add a 1-page roadmap, and tie responses precisely to each ask.

### Common Pitfalls (EB-1A)
- **Memberships** without merit-based criteria.  
- **Insular** company-only proof without independent validators.  
- **Overstuffed** exhibits (quality > quantity).  
- **Ignoring** visa availability and chart flips.  
- Assuming I-485 **auto-grants** work/travel (file **I-765/I-131**).

### FAQ (EB-1A)
**Do I need an employer?** No, it’s **self-petitionable**; you must intend to continue in your field.  
**Is 3 criteria = approval?** No—must pass **Final Merits**.  
**Can I premium-process?** Yes (I-907).  
**Concurrent file?** If AOS-eligible and visa numbers are available that month.

## EB-2 NIW (National Interest Waiver)

### Quick-Start Checklist (NIW)
- [ ] Define your **Proposed Endeavor** (what, where, who benefits, U.S. nexus, 12–24-mo plan).  
- [ ] Prove **EB-2** first: **Advanced Degree** *or* **Exceptional Ability** (≥3 of 6 + final-merits context).  
- [ ] Build **Dhanasar** proof: **(1) merit & national importance**, **(2) well positioned**, **(3) balance test**.  
- [ ] Draft a **cover letter** with a 1-page roadmap and three prong sections cross-referenced to exhibits.  
- [ ] Collect **independent letters** (credentialed, specific) + **objective indicators** (adoption, revenue, grants, citations, standards).  
- [ ] Choose **AOS vs. Consular**. If PD is **current**, consider **concurrent** I-140 + I-485 (+I-765/I-131).  
- [ ] Verify **current fees** and editions (USCIS Fee Calculator / G-1055).  
- [ ] Assign **evidence owners** for each prong; lock the exhibit index.

### NIW Evidence Map (1-Page)
**Proposed Endeavor (front-page abstract)**  
- Problem/need (U.S. impact) → Solution (what you’ll do) → Path to scale (partners, milestones, KPIs) → Policy/market context.

**Prong 1 — Substantial Merit & National Importance**  
- U.S.-level relevance (federal strategies, critical tech, public health, infra, climate, supply chains).  
- Objective impact: deployments, scale, standards roles, third-party outcomes.  
- Evidence: policy citations, market data, stakeholder letters, published results.

**Prong 2 — Well Positioned to Advance**  
- Track record: shipped systems, patents **with use**, grants, peer review/judging, leadership, prior U.S. collaborations.  
- Plan: named partners, timeline, budget, risks/mitigation, resources.  
- Evidence: contracts/MOUs, awards, product metrics, media about *you* (not ads).

**Prong 3 — Balance Test**  
- Why PERM/job-offer is misaligned: cross-functional/entrepreneurial/time-critical work.  
- Benefit of waiving: speed to impact, national competitiveness.  
- Evidence: timeline sensitivity, agency/industry support.

**EB-2 Threshold (before NIW)**  
- Advanced degree (or bachelor’s + 5 yrs progressive) *or* Exceptional Ability (≥3 of 6 + final merits).  
- **Comparable evidence** where a listed factor doesn’t fit.

### What EB-2 NIW Is
An employment-based path that **waives PERM and a specific job offer** if you qualify for **EB-2** and meet **Dhanasar’s** three prongs. It’s a **self-petition** on **I-140**; if your **priority date** is current, you can **file I-485 concurrently** and add **I-765/I-131**.

### Step 1 — Qualify for EB-2
- **Advanced Degree**: U.S. master’s (or foreign equivalent) *or* bachelor’s + **5 years progressive** post-bachelor’s experience.  
- **Exceptional Ability**: **≥3 of 6** factors (academic record, license, 10+ years experience letters, high salary, memberships, recognition) + **final merits**; **comparable evidence** allowed.

### Step 2 — Win the NIW (Dhanasar)
1) **Substantial merit & national importance**  
2) **Well positioned to advance**  
3) **On balance**, the U.S. benefits by **waiving** the job-offer/PERM requirement  
*Standard:* **preponderance of the evidence**; NIW is **discretionary** even when prongs are met.

### How to Package (NIW)
- **Cover letter**: 1-page roadmap → EB-2 threshold → Prong 1 → Prong 2 → Prong 3 → closing merits paragraph.  
- **Exhibits**: tabbed, paginated, clearly named (`P2_Adoption_UtilityLetters.pdf`).  
- **Letters**: independent where possible; 1–2 pages; quantify outcomes.  
- **Translations**: certified; include source scans.  
- **Consistency**: reconcile dates/titles/numbers across exhibits.

### Filing Flow (NIW)
1) File **I-140 (NIW)**.  
2) If PD **current**, file **I-485** **concurrently** (+ **I-765/I-131**) or wait until current.  
3) **AOS** vs. **Consular Processing** via **NVC/CEAC** — pick what fits your situation.  
4) Track **Visa Bulletin** and USCIS’s **AOS filing chart** monthly.

### Premium Processing & Timelines (NIW)
- **I-140 NIW**: PP available; windows in **business days**.  
- PP only accelerates **I-140** (not I-485/EAD/AP).

### Common Pitfalls (NIW)
- EB-2 “**three-of-six**” without **final-merits** context.  
- Vague endeavor (no scope/milestones/U.S. partners).  
- Letters with praise but **no specifics**.  
- Fee/edition mistakes; ignoring AOS chart.  
- Assuming I-485 **auto-grants** work/travel (file **I-765/I-131**).

### FAQ (NIW)
**Do I need an employer?** No; NIW is a self-petition.  
**Is NIW easier than EB-1A?** Different standards/structures.  
**Premium Processing?** Yes for **I-140 NIW** (business days).  
**Concurrent filing?** If PD is **current** and you’re AOS-eligible.
