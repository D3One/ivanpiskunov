# Practitioner Glossary

*This glossary trims fluff, fixes common misconceptions, and adds the practical terms you’ll actually see across endorsement + visa filings, extensions, and ILR. Items in **bold** are the ones that trip people up most often. Short, plain-English definitions first; quick notes and gotchas in italics.*

---

## Agencies, routes & endorsers you’ll see

* **Home Office / UKVI** — The immigration authority and its casework arm. You’ll submit Stage 2 on **GOV.UK** and manage your **eVisa** in a **UKVI account**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Endorsing bodies** — Sector experts engaged by the Home Office to assess Stage 1: **UKRI** (research/academia), **Arts Council England** (+ specialist partners like **RIBA**, **PACT**), and the **digital technology** route handled via the GOV.UK endorsement application (criteria published on GOV.UK and partner pages). *Pick the body that actually fits your field.* ([GOV.UK][2])

---

## Application mechanics (what happens when)

* **Stage 1 (Endorsement)** — Proves you’re a **Leader (Exceptional Talent)** or **Potential Leader (Exceptional Promise)**, unless you qualify via the **Prestigious Prizes** list. *Your endorsement letter is typically valid for **3 months** to file Stage 2.* ([GOV.UK][3])
* **Stage 2 (Visa)** — Entry clearance (outside the UK) or in-country “switch.” Published service standards: ~**3 weeks** outside; **~8 weeks** inside (subject to paid priority upgrades and operational changes). ([GOV.UK][4])
* **Apply together?** — You *may* file Stage 2 at the same time as Stage 1; if endorsement later fails, the visa fee is refunded (endorsement fee isn’t). ([GOV.UK][5])

## A–Z core terms (tight definitions, fast lookups)

### **Appendix Global Talent (Immigration Rules)**

The rulebook for eligibility, extensions, and **ILR**. *For extensions/ILR you must show **UK earnings in your field** during your most recent grant—no fixed minimum, but the income must be **from the UK** and **related** to your endorsed/prize field.* ([GOV.UK][6])

### **Appendix Global Talent: Prestigious Prizes**

If you hold an eligible prize from the official list, you can **skip endorsement** and go straight to the visa. *The list is updated; check the current version before relying on this shortcut.* ([GOV.UK][7])

### **Arts & Culture (ACE route)**

Endorsement for arts, culture, architecture (**RIBA**), film/TV (**PACT**), etc. *Reviewers look for national/international recognition, portfolio, press, juried awards, and strong industry letters.* ([Arts Council][8])

### **Digital Technology route**

For technologists and tech leaders. *As of 2025, submit the Stage-1 application through **GOV.UK**; follow the current criteria pages rather than legacy private portals.* ([GOV.UK][5])

### **eVisa / UKVI account / Share Code**

The UK is phasing out physical BRPs. Your immigration status is digital (**eVisa**) and accessed via a **UKVI account**, from which you can generate a **share code** to prove right to work/rent. ([GOV.UK][1])

### **Endorsed Funder route (Research)**

A fast-track UKRI subroute where your project is funded by an **approved** funder and hosted by an eligible UK institution. *One of four research pathways (with academic appointment, individual fellowship, and peer review).* ([UK Research and Innovation][9])

### **Endorsement letter validity**

Your Stage-1 approval generally expires if you don’t file Stage-2 within **3 months**; you’d need to re-apply for endorsement. *Don’t miss this clock.* ([Staff Immigration][10])

### **Exceptional Talent vs. Exceptional Promise**

Labels used by endorsers to distinguish established **leaders** from **emerging leaders**. *Impacts your ILR timeline (often 3 vs 5 years, route-specific).* ([GOV.UK][11])

### **Global Talent (the visa)**

Unsponsored, flexible work route for leaders/potential leaders in **research**, **arts/culture**, or **digital technology**. You can be employed, self-employed, or a director; no set salary threshold. *You can apply directly with an eligible prize or via endorsement.* ([GOV.UK][12])

### **ILR (Indefinite Leave to Remain)**

Permanent residence. Many Global Talent holders qualify for **ILR after 3 years** (others after **5**) depending on route and label. *For continuous residence you must usually stay within **180 days**’ absences per rolling 12 months; crucially, for those endorsed by **Royal Society / RAEng / British Academy / UKRI**, **overseas research absences do not count** toward that limit.* ([GOV.UK][11])

### **IHS (Immigration Health Surcharge)**

A per-year fee paid at Stage-2 for access to the NHS. *Paid up-front for the full visa length; check the current rate before filing.*

### **Peer Review (Research)**

A non-fast-track UKRI route based on a full dossier rather than a qualifying job/fellowship/funder. ([GOV.UK][13])

### **Processing times (service standards)**

Published targets: **~3 weeks** outside; **~8 weeks** inside (can vary; priority services may shorten). *Always check the current GOV.UK page before you plan start dates.* ([GOV.UK][4])

### **RIBA / PACT (Specialist assessors)**

Architecture endorsements are assessed with **RIBA** involvement; film/TV with **PACT**. *Submit to the right sub-panel or your file may be bounced for fit.* ([Arts Council][8])

### **Security-sensitive work & ATAS**

**Endorsement does not equal security clearance.** For certain sensitive research fields, **ATAS** or other checks may still apply. *Confirm separately with your employer/host.* ([Royal Society][14])

### **Stage 1 / Stage 2**

Shorthand for **Endorsement** (Stage-1) and **Visa** (Stage-2). *You can file Stage-2 with Stage-1 to save time; if endorsement is refused, the visa fee is refunded automatically.* ([GOV.UK][5])

### **Switching (in-UK applications)**

Changing into Global Talent from another status while in the UK (subject to rules). *Processing is typically up to ~8 weeks; consider priority upgrades as available.* ([GOV.UK][15])

### **UK earnings in field (extensions & ILR)**

To extend or settle you must evidence **UK-sourced earnings** in your endorsed/prize field during your most recent grant. *There’s **no minimum threshold**, but documentation must be clean (PAYE, invoices, royalties, accountant letters, etc.).* ([GOV.UK][6])

### **UKRI (UK Research and Innovation)**

Umbrella for research endorsements. Publishes diagrams/guidance for the 4 routes and what evidence qualifies (appointments, fellowships, endorsed funders, peer review). ([UK Research and Innovation][9])

## Quick myth-busting (so you don’t step on rakes)

* **“Endorsement = visa.”** — **False.** It’s Stage-1 only; you must still pass Stage-2 (immigration checks, biometrics, IHS, etc.). ([GOV.UK][12])
* **“Absences kill my ILR if I travel for research.”** — **Not always.** If endorsed by **Royal Society / RAEng / British Academy / UKRI**, **research travel doesn’t count** toward the 180-day cap. ([GOV.UK][16])
* **“My endorsement letter never expires.”** — **No.** Stage-2 typically must be filed within **3 months** of endorsement. ([Staff Immigration][10])
* **“Any income counts for extensions/ILR.”** — **No.** It must be **earned in the UK** and **in your field**. No set minimum, but **evidence quality matters**. ([GOV.UK][6])

*Pro tip:* **Keep a running file** of UK-source earnings, contracts, and right-to-work **share codes**—you’ll thank yourself at extension/ILR time.
