## Quick-Start Checklist
- [ ] Pick the **correct route** (Research / Arts & Culture / Digital Tech).  
- [ ] Decide the **label**: **Exceptional Talent** (leader) vs **Exceptional Promise** (emerging leader).  
- [ ] Draft a **route-specific cover letter** with 1-page roadmap and ≤10 hard-hitting exhibits.  
- [ ] Secure **3 recommendation letters** that match your route’s format (Arts often requires ≥1 UK-based letter).  
- [ ] Build a **UK plan** (12–24 months): collaborators, venues/employers, milestones, KPIs.  
- [ ] File **Stage 1 (Endorsement)**; within **3 months** of the endorsement letter, file **Stage 2 (Visa)**.  
- [ ] Track **ILR horizon** (3 vs 5 years) and absence/earnings rules from day one.

## 1-Page Evidence Map (by Route)

### Research / Academia
**What lands:**  
- Fast-track evidence (academic/research **appointment**, **eligible fellowship**, **endorsed funder**) *or* a strong **peer-review** dossier.  
- **Publications/citations**, **grants**, **standards/consortia roles**, invited talks, supervision, and **UK collaborations**.  
- **Letters** from PIs/department heads, funders, or society fellows, speaking to impact and leadership.

**UK angle:** host institution fit, project plan, and how the work advances UK research priorities.  
**ILR note:** typically **3 years**; **research absences** can be exempt from the 180-day rule.

### Arts & Culture
**What lands:**  
- National/international **recognition**: juried awards, major festivals/exhibitions, press, sales/audience metrics.  
- **Portfolio** (≤10 items) curated for quality, plus **3 letters** (often **≥1 UK-based**).  
- Clear **UK plan**: venues, commissioners, residencies, co-producers.

**Label logic:** Talent = substantial multi-country record; Promise = earlier career but fast trajectory.  
**ILR note:** **Talent = 3 years**, **Promise = 5 years** (typical).

### Digital Technology
**What lands:**  
- **Product-led innovation** and **sector impact**: shipped products, OSS leadership, commercial traction, patents with use.  
- **Leadership** (technical or executive), peer review/jury service, community impact.  
- **3 letters** from senior industry figures; **≤10 exhibits** with recency (typically last 5 years).

**Label logic:** Promise is **likely <5 years** of experience; Talent shows recognized leadership.  
**ILR note:** **Talent = 3 years**, **Promise = 5 years** (typical).

---

## Talent vs Promise (Label Choice)
- **Talent**: sustained leadership and cross-border outcomes.  
- **Promise**: earlier career with a credible, evidenced trajectory toward leadership (especially if **<5 years** experience in Digital Tech).  
Pick the label that matches your portfolio maturity and **ILR timeline** needs.

---

## Stage 1 — Endorsement
- Submit via the **GOV.UK** route page (no legacy portals).  
- Follow route-specific **letter** and **evidence** limits exactly (Arts is strict on letter mix).  
- Your endorsement letter is normally valid for **3 months** to file Stage 2.

---

## Stage 2 — Visa
- Apply outside the UK (**~3 weeks**) or switch inside (**~8 weeks**) per published targets.  
- Set up your **UKVI account**; your status is an **eVisa** (use **share codes** for right-to-work/rent).  
- Pay the **IHS** for the full visa length up front.

---

## ILR (Settlement): 3 vs 5 Years
- **Research routes**: usually **3 years** regardless of label; **research absences** may be exempt from the 180-day rule.  
- **Arts & Digital Tech**: **3 years (Talent)** vs **5 years (Promise)**.  
- **Earnings rule** for extension/ILR: show **UK-source earnings in your field** during your most recent grant (no fixed minimum; documentation quality matters).

---

## How to Package the File
- **Cover letter** (5–10 pp): one-page thesis → route+label → evidence chapters → UK plan (esp. for Promise).  
- **Exhibits**: ≤10, dated, attributable, and independently verifiable.  
- **Letters**: senior, specific, and credentialed; for Arts, include a **UK-based** letter when required.  
- **Consistency**: reconcile names/titles/dates across letters, portfolio, and CV.

---

## Common Pitfalls
- Picking **Promise** when your record screams **Talent** (or vice versa).  
- Over-length evidence with low signal; **quality > quantity**.  
- Arts: wrong **letter geometry** (count/origin) → refusals on format alone.  
- Weak UK plan (no named partners/venues/employers).  
- Ignoring ILR rules (absences, UK-source earnings) until year 3.

## Micro-Checklists

### Researchers
- [ ] Which pathway: **appointment / fellowship / endorsed funder / peer review**

- [ ] 3 heavyweight letters (C-suite/VP/Principal Engineer/VC partner)  
- [ ] ≤10 exhibits (last 5 years), each with metrics and your role
