**Subject:** Innovator Founder — Endorsement Inquiry for {{CompanyName}} ({{Sector}})

Hello {{EB Contact or Team}},

I’m {{FullName}}, founder and director of **{{CompanyName}}**, a {{one-liner: product + who it serves}} based in {{City/Country}}. We’re applying for **Innovator Founder** and believe **{{EB Name}}** is the right fit because of your track record with {{sector or model}}.

**Why this is innovative:**
- {{1-sentence moat or novel method}}
- {{1-sentence UK fit (market gap, regulation, ecosystem)}}

**Traction to date:**
- {{Metric 1: revenue/users/pilots with names if allowed}}
- {{Metric 2: partnerships, grants, or IP}}
- {{Metric 3: growth signal—MRR, retention, pipeline}}

**UK plan (12–24 months):**
- {{Milestone 1: launch, hiring, certifications}}
- {{Milestone 2: partnerships or distribution}}
- {{Milestone 3: export or R&D goals}}

**Attachments (concise):**
1) Founder memo (2 pages)
2) Deck / business plan
3) Traction appendix (invoices/LOIs/analytics/IP)
4) Corporate docs (cap table, director letter)

Could we schedule a 20-minute intro to confirm fit and next steps for endorsement?

Thank you,

### Tips
- Keep attachments tight (≤15–20 MB total). Clear filenames: `01_FounderMemo.pdf`, `02_Deck.pdf`, etc.
- If the EB publishes a fee + meeting schedule, acknowledge it and confirm you’re ready to proceed.
- If your sector is regulated, mention any UK approvals you’ll pursue (e.g., FCA, MHRA, Ofcom).
