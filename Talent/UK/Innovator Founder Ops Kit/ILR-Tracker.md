# ILR Criteria Tracker (Innovator Founder)

> Track progress toward **any 2 of 7** qualifying criteria for ILR at year 3. Update monthly. Assign an owner for each criterion and keep an evidence link.

## How to Use
- Pick **two target criteria** on Day 1 and design your reporting around them.
- Update the table once a month in your leadership meeting (10 minutes).
- Store proofs in `/evidence/` and link them here.
- Remember: you must also be a director/member of an **active, trading, sustainable** UK company and obtain an updated **endorser letter** confirming significant achievements.

_Pro tip:_ Name an owner per criterion; use issue labels like `ilr-criterion:1` to tag tasks that move the needle.
