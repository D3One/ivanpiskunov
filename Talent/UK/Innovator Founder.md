# The UK Innovator Founder Visa (2025). Guide for Startup Founders

*This is your one-stop, plain-English walkthrough of the Innovator Founder route: what it is, who qualifies, how endorsement works, fees and timing, what you can do on the visa, and how to hit the settlement (ILR) milestones in three years. I’ve baked in practical tips and cut the fluff so you can move fast and avoid unforced errors.*

---

## 1) What This Visa Is—And Why Founders Choose It

*The Innovator Founder visa lets you relocate to the UK to build an **innovative, viable, and scalable** business you lead day-to-day. It replaced the old Innovator and Start-up visas in April 2023 and is now the UK’s flagship founder route.* ([GOV.UK][1])

**Headline perks:**

* **3-year grant** with unlimited 3-year extensions. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Fast track to ILR in 3 years** if you meet business traction criteria (details in §10). ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Side employment allowed** (outside your own venture) so long as it’s **RQF Level 3+** (A-level equivalent). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **No fixed minimum investment** to apply (the old £50k rule is gone), though your endorser may expect credible funding for delivery. ([GOV.UK][3])

*Pro tip:* *Think of endorsement as your real “gate.” Nail that and the visa is largely procedural.*

---

## 2) Who Qualifies (at a Glance)

*You qualify if you’re building something genuinely new (or defensibly better) and can prove founder-level execution capability.*

Baseline requirements:

* **Endorsement** by a Home Office-approved endorsing body (EB). ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Business meets IVS**: innovative, viable, scalable—plus clear competitive edge and realistic delivery. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **English** at **CEFR B2** in reading, writing, speaking, listening. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Maintenance**: If applying from abroad (or in the UK <12 months), show **£1,270** personal funds; dependants need **£285 spouse / £315 first child / £200 each additional child**. ([GOV.UK][2])

*Founder reality check:* *“Innovative” ≠ hype. Your EB will expect market need, moat, and a credible route to scale.*

---

## 3) Endorsing Bodies (EBs): How the Gatekeeping Works

*Endorsers are vetted organizations authorized to back founders. You can only use those on the official list.* ([GOV.UK][4])

What to know:

* **Only listed bodies may endorse**—avoid off-list offers. ([GOV.UK][4])
* **Endorsement letter validity: 3 months** from issue—file the visa application before it expires. ([GOV.UK][5])
* **Contact points**: You’ll have **mandatory check-ins at 12 and 24 months**; failure or withdrawal can **curtail** your leave. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **EB fees (paid to the EB)**: **£1,000** for endorsement, **£500** **per contact meeting** (at least two). ([GOV.UK][4])

*Founder tip:* *Choose an EB that actually “gets” your sector and has bandwidth to support you—this isn’t just a rubber stamp.*

---

## 4) What You Can (and Can’t) Do

**Allowed:**

* Set up and run **one or more** businesses; be a **director** or **self-employed partner**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* Take **skilled** outside employment (**RQF3+**). ([GOV.UK][1])
* Bring **dependants** (partner/children). ([GOV.UK][1])

**Not allowed:**

* **Public funds** and **professional sportsperson** roles. ([GOV.UK][1])

*Reality check:* *Side gigs help cash flow, but the EB must still see you in a **day-to-day** leadership role in the venture.* ([GOV.UK][2])

---

## 5) Process & Timeline (Two Stages)

1. **Endorsement** → build your case (plan + evidence) → EB issues a reference letter (valid 3 months). ([GOV.UK][5])
2. **Visa application** (online). Typical decisions: **~3 weeks** from outside the UK; **~8 weeks** inside. Expedited options may exist. ([GOV.UK][1])

*Founder tip:* *Back-time from the 3-month endorsement clock. Aim to file your visa within 2–6 weeks of issue to keep slack for biometrics or ID app hiccups.*

---

## 6) Costs You Should Budget For

* **Home Office fee**: **£1,274** per person outside the UK; **£1,590** to extend/switch inside the UK. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **EB fees**: **£1,000** endorsement; **£500** per required check-in. ([GOV.UK][4])
* **Immigration Health Surcharge (IHS)**: **£1,035/year (adult)**, **£776/year (under 18; students)**—paid upfront for the visa term. ([GOV.UK][6])

*Money-saving note:* *IHS stacks quickly for families—run the math before you add optional years.* ([Parliament Research Briefings][7])

---

## 7) Documents & Evidence (What EBs and UKVI Actually Look For)

**Core items:**

* **Endorsement letter** (within 3 months of application). ([GOV.UK][8])
* **Passport/ID**, **English at B2**, **maintenance funds** (if required), **TB test** if applicable, and any **identity/biometrics** steps (visa center or **UK Immigration: ID Check** app). ([GOV.UK][2])

**Business pack essentials (for EB):**

* **Business plan** addressing **innovation**, **competitive advantage**, **go-to-market**, **unit economics**, **scalability roadmap**. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Proof of founder role** and **day-to-day** responsibility (cap table, board role, employment/consulting history). ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Traction signals**: LoIs, pilots, revenue, pipeline, IP filings, R&D, strategic partnerships. *(These become key later for ILR criteria—see §10.)* ([GOV.UK][2])

*Formatting tip:* *Make your EB pack read like a seed-stage investor memo—tight metrics, crisp slides, and verifiable appendices.*

---

## 8) Switching in the UK

*Already in the UK? You can **switch** into Innovator Founder from many routes (but not from Visit, Short-term Student, Seasonal Worker, Domestic Worker, or immigration bail/”outside the rules”). Student switchers generally need to have **completed** their course or be **24 months into a PhD**.* ([GOV.UK][9])

---

## 9) Life on the Visa: Compliance 101

* **Keep your endorsement alive**: attend the **12- and 24-month** check-ins; keep the EB updated; material changes can require re-assessment. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **Work condition**: outside employment must be **RQF3+**; your **primary** role remains running the endorsed business. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **eVisa & right to work**: set up your **UKVI account**, use **share codes** to prove status to employers/landlords. ([GOV.UK][10])

*Founder tip:* *Link your passport to your **eVisa** before travel so airline checks don’t bounce.* ([GOV.UK][11])

---

## 10) Settlement (ILR) After 3 Years: The Traction Test

*To settle in 3 years, you’ll need: (a) an EB letter confirming **significant achievements** against your plan, (b) proof you’re a **director/member** of an **active, trading, sustainable** UK company, and (c) that your venture met **at least two** of the **seven** criteria below.* ([GOV.UK][2])

Meet **any 2** of these:

1. **≥ £50,000 invested and actively spent** to grow the business; or ([GOV.UK][2])
2. **Customers doubled** in the past 3 years **and** now **above the sector mean**; or ([GOV.UK][2])
3. **Significant R&D** and a **UK IP filing**; or ([GOV.UK][2])
4. **£1,000,000+** **annual gross revenue** (last full year); or ([GOV.UK][2])
5. **£500,000+ revenue** with **£100,000+ exports** (last full year); or ([GOV.UK][2])
6. **10+ full-time equivalent jobs** for **settled workers**; or ([GOV.UK][2])
7. **5+ FTE jobs** where the **average salary is ≥ £25,000** (gross, excl. allowances). ([GOV.UK][2])

**Job-count fine print:** roles must exist **12+ months**, average **≥30 hrs/week** (part-time can combine), and comply with wage law. Team members can’t “double count” the same metric for separate ILR bids. ([GOV.UK][2])

**Other ILR boxes:** **3 years** continuous residence and **Knowledge of Life in the UK** test. ([GOV.UK][2])

*Founder tip:* *Pick your two target criteria **on day one** and instrument your data to prove them (bookkeeping, payroll, IP receipts, export invoices).*

---

## 11) Dependants (Partner & Kids)

*Your family can join you and work (except as professional sportspersons). If applying with <12 months’ UK residence, show dependant maintenance funds (see §2).* ([GOV.UK][2])

---

## 12) Practical Playbook: How Strong Cases are Built

*Use this as a sprint checklist.*

* **Problem → Solution → Edge**: quantify pain, show the wedge, and why now. *(Innovation & moat)* ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Go-to-Market**: ICP, channels, sales cycle, pricing tests, compliance. *(Viability)* ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Scale plan**: hiring map, ops, infra, UK footprint, export strategy. *(Scalability)* ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Evidence locker**: pilot MOUs, revenue, user growth, patents/UK IPO filings, investor notes, grants, letters from UK partners. *(Feeds ILR criteria)* ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Compliance spine**: contact points calendar, right-to-work share code setup, payroll and Companies House hygiene. ([GOV.UK][12])

*Pro tip:* *If you’ll need to hire overseas talent, map out a **Skilled Worker sponsor licence** early so you can issue Certificates of Sponsorship to your team.* ([GOV.UK][13])

---

## 13) Fees & Timing—Quick Reference

* **Visa fee**: **£1,274** (outside UK); **£1,590** (extend/switch in UK). **Decision:** ~**3 / 8 weeks**. ([GOV.UK][1])
* **IHS**: **£1,035/yr** adults; **£776/yr** children under 18 (paid upfront). ([GOV.UK][6])
* **Endorser**: **£1,000** initial; **£500**/check-in (2x minimum). ([GOV.UK][4])

*Note:* *Fees move—always reconfirm on GOV.UK before you file.* ([GOV.UK][1])

---

## 14) Common Pitfalls (and How to Dodge Them)

* **Letting the endorsement letter lapse** (3-month shelf life). *Set internal deadlines.* ([GOV.UK][5])
* **Under-documenting founder role**—UKVI and EBs expect hands-on management. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Side job below RQF3**—that’s a breach. Keep roles skilled. ([GOV.UK][2])
* **Ignoring ILR criteria until year 3**—start measuring from month 1. ([GOV.UK][2])

---

## 15) Related Pathways & Building Your UK Team

* **Skilled Worker (self-sponsorship or hires)**—secure a **sponsor licence** to bring talent in. Typical licence steps: check eligibility, apply online, submit docs, pass compliance; guidance updated in 2025. ([GOV.UK][13])
* **Right to Work**: share codes via your **UKVI account** for you and staff. ([GOV.UK][12])
