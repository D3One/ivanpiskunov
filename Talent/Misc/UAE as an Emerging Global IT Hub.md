# Dubai / UAE as an Emerging Global IT Hub

## 1. Government Strategies and Policy Support

* **UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence 2031**
  Launched in 2017 as part of the Centennial 2071 vision. The goal is to position the UAE as a global leader in artificial intelligence, integrating AI into healthcare, education, transportation, energy, and government services.

* **Dubai AI Lab & Digital Dubai Program**
    • AI Lab (in partnership with IBM) focuses on embedding AI into public services, projects, and training.
    • Initiatives include the *AI Principles & Ethics Framework*, *Blockchain Strategy*, *Paperless Strategy*, and the *Happiness Agenda*.

* **Golden Visa Expansion**
  In 2023 alone, approximately **158,000 Golden Visas** were issued in Dubai, with around 22% going to professionals in banking, AI, climate tech, and technology-related fields. The program now targets high-level specialists and innovators, not just wealthy investors.

* **Dubai Integrated Economic Zones Authority (DIEZ)**
  DIEZ oversees zones such as Dubai Airport Freezone, Dubai Silicon Oasis, and CommerCity. By 2025, these zones host **more than 700 AI-focused companies**, demonstrating rapid sectoral growth.

* **Public–Private Collaboration Programs**
  Dubai invites AI companies and experts to co-create government service solutions through accelerator programs. Selected firms often receive incentives, housing, and funding, without the government taking equity.

## 5. Comparison with Other IT Hubs

* **Visa Schemes**: Similar to the U.S. (O-1, H-1B), the UK (Global Talent Visa), and the EU (Blue Card, Digital Nomad programs), but the UAE tends to move faster and with less bureaucracy.

## 7. Conclusion

Dubai and the wider UAE are rapidly positioning themselves as **global magnets for IT and AI talent**. For Russian and other international specialists, the UAE offers:

* Financial advantages (zero income tax, business incentives).
* Speed of relocation and company setup.
* Access to large government-backed innovation projects.

At the same time, researchers should note the **structural dependence on government initiatives**, potential **legal-cultural barriers**, and the need for further development of local research ecosystems.
