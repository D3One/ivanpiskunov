# The U.S. Is the Strongest Economy in the World: Why, How, and What’s Next?

## Executive Summary

The United States remains the world’s most dynamic large economy: it leads by absolute GDP, dominates global equity markets and venture formation, and maintains a uniquely deep innovation ecosystem powered by private‑sector R&D and research universities. A favorable business climate, global capital inflows, and the dollar’s reserve‑currency status reinforce this leadership. While America’s share of world output is likely to drift lower over time as Asia grows, the U.S. retains decisive advantages in productivity, innovation capacity, and financial depth, positioning it to stay the world’s economic center of gravity in the foreseeable future.

## The U.S. economy accounts for a quarter of global GDP

In 2023, U.S. GDP reached $27.4 trillion[^1], ranking first worldwide. China, in second place, is almost $10 trillion smaller, and Russia’s economy is roughly 14 times smaller.

The largest transnational corporations are headquartered in the United States: 23 of the world’s top 30 public companies are American[^2]. Silicon Valley is the world’s IT capital, and the primary global financial center is New York.

The United States accounts for around 60% of global stock‑market capitalization[^3]. The U.S. dollar is the dominant reserve currency.

Today, nearly 80% of U.S. GDP comes from services[^4]—finance, retail, communications, and more. For decades, U.S. economic growth has been driven less by traditional industry and more by innovation.

The U.S. is responsible for roughly a quarter of global R&D[^5]. The country spends about 3.6% of GDP on research[^6], or roughly $2,500 per capita[^7].

## R&D, higher education, and science

Accelerated development of high technology in the U.S. is driven primarily by the private sector, which improves investment efficiency.

Of the 2,500 global technology companies with the highest R&D spending, roughly one third are American[^8]. For example, in 2020 Alphabet alone invested about $25 billion in R&D[^9]. Total R&D spending was $716 billion across the entire U.S. economy[^10].

America’s research universities hold leading positions across major international rankings. According to *Times Higher Education*, eight of the world’s top 10 universities are in the U.S.[^11] Research productivity also shows up in prestigious awards: the United States accounts for about half of all Nobel laureates in the sciences[^12].

## A favorable business climate

The United States is a global hub of business activity. There are more than 33 million enterprises[^13], predominantly small and medium‑sized businesses, which together account for a large share of U.S. GDP. This breadth makes the economy highly competitive and resilient. For comparison, in Russia in 2023 there were about 2.6 million operating companies[^14], and SMEs accounted for only about 20% of GDP[^15].

Private enterprise is the backbone of the U.S. economy. The government’s direct contribution to GDP does not exceed roughly 10–12%[^5] and is minimal in the real sector.

U.S. businesses are highly efficient: strong innovation investment boosts labor productivity. Among major economies, U.S. labor productivity is the highest—one worker produces, on average, about $70 of output per hour[^16].

Historically, the World Bank’s Doing Business program ranked the U.S. business climate ahead of most large economies, evaluating the tax burden, access to credit, regulatory transparency, property‑rights protection, and the ease of starting a business[^17].

Startups play an outsized role in the U.S. economy. They account for more than half of all firms and a large share of output. In 2023 alone, more than 5.5 million businesses were created in the United States[^18]. U.S. startups also scale faster than their counterparts elsewhere. In 2023, the United States accounted for about half of all unicorns worldwide[^19].

The U.S. investment climate is among the most attractive in the world. The country is the largest recipient of foreign direct investment: in 2022, inward FDI positions totaled about $5.3 trillion—roughly 24% of the global total[^20]. Over the past 20 years, non‑residents have increased their U.S. assets several‑fold, to approximately $47.3 trillion[^20].

## International trade

In 2023, the United States imported goods and services worth about $3.17 trillion[^21], representing roughly 13.5% of global imports[^21].

The U.S. is also the world’s largest consumer market. In 2022, Americans spent nearly $17.5 trillion[^22]—about 2.5 times more than consumers in China, despite China’s population being roughly four times larger. The difference stems largely from higher wages and productivity in the United States.

## A strong stock market

Almost half of the world’s securities transactions are executed in the United States. Two major exchanges—the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and Nasdaq—list roughly 6,000 equities and depositary receipts and 2,000 ETFs. These listings include not only U.S. issuers but also leading companies from all regions of the world, and a significant portion of U.S. equities are held by foreign investors.

The steady inflow of capital has fueled a dramatic rise in U.S. market capitalization: over the past two decades it has roughly quadrupled and exceeded $50 trillion[^24] at the start of this year. Nearly a quarter of that value is concentrated in the “Magnificent Seven”—a cohort of large‑cap technology companies led by Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia.

For comparison, China’s most valuable public company, Tencent, is about 7.5 times smaller than Apple[^25]. And Microsoft’s market capitalization is equivalent to roughly 50 times Russia’s Sberbank[^25].

High returns are another reason global investors choose U.S. equities. From 2012 to 2022, U.S. stocks delivered an average real return of about 8% per year[^26].

## The Dollar as the World’s Leading Currency

According to the International Monetary Fund, more than 80% of global trade transactions are conducted in U.S. dollars[^27]. Central banks also trust the dollar, which accounts for about 60% of global foreign‑exchange reserves[^28].

## The future of the United States

Over the past 20 years, America’s share of the global economy has declined—from roughly one‑third of world GDP at the start of the century to about one‑quarter today. In that sense, the formal peak of U.S. hegemony may be in the past. Even so, the country retains leading positions on key macroeconomic indicators.

In recent decades, the epicenter of global economic growth has shifted from West to East. The U.S. share of world output will likely continue to drift down as fast‑growing Asian economies—such as India, Indonesia, and Vietnam—expand. At the same time, China’s role as a challenger to the U.S. has proven less formidable than many expected: the Chinese economy is slowing, global demand for “Made in China” goods is softening, and the country’s population—and thus its labor force—has begun to shrink.

While U.S. GDP no longer grows at the blistering pace of the 1990s, when the country accelerated following the end of the Cold War, the American economy has posted a fairly steady ~2.5% average annual growth rate for a quarter century (excluding the pandemic shock and the 2008 crisis).

U.S. public debt is another frequent source of skepticism. As of September 2024, the national debt exceeded $35 trillion[^29]—about a third of global sovereign debt—and amounted to roughly 122% of U.S. GDP. According to Bank of America estimates, the debt may increase by about $5.2 billion per day and could reach $50 trillion by 2033[^30]. Even so, few observers see a realistic risk of default: U.S. Treasury securities remain the world’s benchmark safe asset, widely used as cash equivalents and collateral.
