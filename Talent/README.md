> **A practical, step-by-step guide based on my personal journey to securing an EB-1A extraordinary ability visa for the United States and insights into the UK's Global Talent Visa. No fluff, just actionable insights.**

Welcome! This repository is a curated collection of articles and resources detailing my successful application for the U.S. EB-1A visa and my research into the UK's Global Talent Visa. I created this to demystify the process, break down the complex requirements, and provide a clear roadmap for other professionals aiming to prove their "extraordinary ability" or "exceptional talent."

The information here is based on my own experience, extensive research, and a deep dive into the official guidelines from USCIS and UK Visas and Immigration. Think of it as the guide I wish I had when I started.
