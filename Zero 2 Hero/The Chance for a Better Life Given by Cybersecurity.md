### **About the Extended Author’s Edition**

You are reading the extended author’s edition of this booklet. This version goes beyond the original “academic” edition, which was primarily distributed at universities and scientific institutions in Moscow and focused on illustrating Ivan’s career path from a fresh graduate to an exclusive technical expert and, subsequently, a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO).

This new edition includes additional material that provides a broader perspective on the topics discussed. It presents facts, arguments, quotes, expert opinions, and excerpts from research to substantiate the author's claims. Some chapters also include content that, while slightly off the core topic, is crucial for forming your own informed opinions and key takeaways.

The information herein, including specific facts, arguments, statistics, and expert viewpoints, is aggregated from publicly available Russian and English-language sources. The responsibility for the accuracy of this source material lies solely with its original authors.

This booklet does not advocate for any rash actions, nor does it promote or endorse any specific viewpoint, country, product, technology, or methodology. All information is presented **“as is”** and is intended for a mature, critically thinking audience that is open to learning, evolving, and forming its own conclusions. Every reader has the fundamental and undeniable right to make their own choices and live the life they decide for themselves.

The core mission of this booklet is to show you how to unlock your inner potential, seize opportunities, and unleash your talents through the powerful example of Ivan’s career and personal journey, which was built on a foundation of cybersecurity. Its central message is: **“Don’t wait—act.” “Don’t look for opportunities—create them.” “Don’t rely on others—take charge of your own life.” “Face your fears and acknowledge your flaws.” “Don’t resent criticism—work on your weaknesses.” “Don’t live for others—live for yourself and your loved ones.” “Change yourself to change the world for the better.”**

It’s about more than just becoming an expert or a top-tier specialist; it’s about becoming a **leader** in your field. It’s about living not just where you were born, but **where you want**. Not how you were raised to live, but **how you choose to live**. Earning not what someone else dictates, but **what you’re truly worth**. It’s about breaking free from the confines of a cubicle and a cramped apartment, shedding the social role and limiting beliefs you were born into. It’s about becoming the **best version of yourself** so you can use your gifts to make a real impact. **Ivan walked this path. So can you!**

**You**, the person reading this right now, **have the right to a life of dignity**. Your success will inspire many; your failure will help no one. **You are the opportunity!**
