# PE File Structure: Malware's Playground and Analyst's Battlefield

The **Portable Executable (PE)** format is the foundation of executables and DLLs on Windows. Its well-documented structure is a double-edged sword: while it allows Windows to load programs efficiently, it also provides malware authors with a detailed blueprint for hiding their code. Understanding how malware manipulates this structure is crucial for modern digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

## 1 Key Areas of PE Structure Targeted by Malware

Malware exploits the PE format's flexibility to conceal its presence, evade detection, and ensure execution.

### 1.1 The Entry Point and Code Sections
The **Original Entry Point (OEP)** is the first instruction executed by the OS loader. Malware commonly:
*   **Modifies the OEP** to redirect execution to an injected code section or a new, malicious section (e.g., `.malic` or `.inject`).
*   **Packs or encrypts** the main code section (`.text`/`.code`), leaving only a small, benign-looking unpacking stub at the OEP.

### 1.2 Section Table and Sections
The section table defines the purpose and permissions of each part of the file. Malware abuses this by:
*   **Adding New Sections:** Creating new sections with legitimate-sounding names (e.g., `.reloc`, `.data`, `.rsrc`) but with executable permissions (`RX` or `RWX`) to store malicious code.
*   **Modifying Section Characteristics:** Changing the attributes of existing sections (e.g., making the `.data` section executable) to bypass simple heuristic checks.
*   **Code Cavity Injection:** Hiding small pieces of code in the unused space between sections or within sections that have a large virtual size but small raw size.

### 1.3 Import Address Table (IAT)
The IAT is a critical structure that holds addresses of external API functions (e.g., `CreateFile`, `InternetOpenUrl`). Malware often:
*   **Obfuscates or Destroys the IAT** to hinder static analysis. The necessary API addresses are resolved manually at runtime using `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress`, which are the only imports that remain visible.
*   **Uses API Hashing** to avoid directly naming the APIs it needs, making the code more difficult to decipher.

### 1.4 Resources Section
The `.rsrc` section is designed to store application resources like icons, dialogs, and strings. Malware uses it to hide:
*   **Additional payloads** (e.g., other EXEs, DLLs, encrypted configurations).
*   **Encrypted shellcode** that is decrypted and executed only in memory, never touching the disk in a decrypted form.

## 2 How to Detect Malicious Modifications: An Analyst's Guide

Recognizing signs of tampering is key to identifying infected legitimate files or pure malware.

1.  **Structural Inconsistencies:**
    *   **Suspicious Section Names:** Names that don't match common conventions (e.g., `.mal`, `.pack`, `UPX0`), or legitimate names on unusual file types.
    *   **Wrong Section Permissions:** Data sections (e.g., `.data`, `.rsrc`) with executable permissions are a major red flag.
    *   **Entry Point Mismatch:** The OEP pointing outside the main code section (`.text`) is a strong indicator of modification.

2.  **Entropy Analysis:**
    *   High entropy (a measure of randomness) in a section typically indicates encryption or compression, a hallmark of packers and protectors. Legitimate code sections have medium-to-low entropy.

3.  **Import Table Analysis:**
    *   A minimal IAT containing only core DLLs (`kernel32.dll`, `user32.dll`) and functions like `LoadLibrary` and `GetProcAddress` suggests the real imports are hidden.

4.  **Digital Signature Verification:**
    *   Always check the digital signature. A valid signature from a trusted vendor is a good sign, but malware sometimes steals certificates. An invalid signature on a well-known application is a clear warning.

## 3 Essential Tools for PE Analysis

Here are 3-5 indispensable utilities for any malware analyst working with PE files:
