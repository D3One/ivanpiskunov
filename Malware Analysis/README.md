## üéØ Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to:
*   Demonstrate my methodology and technical capabilities in static and dynamic malware analysis.
*   Provide tangible proof of my experience with industry-standard tools and techniques.
*   Document the process of dissecting malicious code, from initial triage to detailed technical breakdown.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**This repository contains analyses of real malware samples.** The samples themselves are stored in password-protected archives (`infected`) with the password `infected` to prevent accidental execution.

*   **Handle with extreme care.** These files are malicious and must only be handled in a secure, isolated environment (e.g., a dedicated virtual machine with no network access).
*   **I am not responsible** for any damage caused by the misuse, mishandling, or accidental execution of these samples. Use this information for educational and research purposes only.

## üî¨ Analysis Challenges

Here is a list of the completed analysis challenges:

| Challenge | Description | Tools Used | Write-up |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dr. Web Challenge** | Technical analysis of a provided malware sample, focusing on its core functionality, persistence mechanisms, and network communication. | IDA Pro, OllyDbg, PEiD, HxD | [Solution](./Dr.Web%20Challenge%20Solution.txt) |
| **Kaspersky Lab Challenge** | In-depth reverse engineering task to uncover the malware's payload, decryption routines, and anti-analysis techniques. | IDA Pro, x64dbg, PE-bear, RegShot | [Solution](./Kaspersky%20Lab%20Challenge%20Solution.txt) |

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Tools of the Trade

My analysis workflow relies on a standard set of powerful reverse engineering and analysis tools:

*   **Disassemblers:** **IDA Pro** (Industry standard for static analysis)
*   **Debuggers:** **OllyDbg**, **x64dbg** (For dynamic analysis and unpacking)
*   **PE Analysis:** **PEiD**, **PE-bear**, **CFF Explorer** (For examining file headers, sections, and imports)
*   **System Monitoring:** **Process Monitor**, **Process Hacker**, **Wireshark** (For behavioral analysis)
*   **Utilities:** **HxD** (Hex editor), **RegShot** (Registry comparison)

## üìú Conclusion

This repository will be updated with new analyses as I continue to develop my expertise in the field of cybersecurity.
